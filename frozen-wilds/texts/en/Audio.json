Those spooky guys showed up today with that creep Blevins to take measurements of our work stations, and next week, they start installing Faro servitors to do our jobs. Bye-bye, Shelly. Bye-bye, Laura. See you never. Hope you enjoy basic income.<br>God, it's going to be weird to say goodbye to this place. When Quentin and I split, this was all I had. Thank god for a job where I could sit at a panel and press buttons and cry all day.<br>Which, I think is why we're doing this. Hiding the tapes of our rehearsals in the dam. These tapes are our memories. Our ghosts. Through them, we get to haunt this place, keep it human in some small way.<br>This control room was where I was sitting when Laura came in dragging an old practice amp and a guitar behind her. \"Shells,\" she said. \"Girl.

We need one.<br>MESSAGE TEXT:<br>Dear Nobody, <br>When I took this job, we had to watch this training holo. And I remember probably 2% of the actual holo. At some point the holo welcomed me to the \"dam family.\" And I felt like A.) that was such a missed opportunity, because they could have called it a \"damily\" and chose not to, and B.) the idea that I would ever think of any of my coworkers as \"family\" was pretty ridiculous.<br>But then, one day, I looked up, and automation had whittled six people down to just Laura and I, and I was signing papers to dissolve the family I thought I had. And suddenly my last coworker, with her faded tattoos and perpetually arched eyebrows, was telling me jokes, and making me listen to bands I'd never heard of, and cheering me up when I cried.<br>Things were really good when it was just the two of us. We used to have these theme days. One time, the sluice gates were open, and we set up beach blankets on one of the catwalks in the intake tower and batted around this inflatable beach ball I had in my apartment for some reason. Laura messed around with the emergency PA and patched in a bunch of classical surf rock songs. We even put sunscreen on the bridges of our noses. Laura called it the \"concrete beach party.\"<br>When Laura brought up band names, I knew pretty much right away that that would be our name. Concrete Beach Party. There was never really any other choice.<br>",

I need to take a break.<br><b>SHELLY:</b> Laura? Hey! Laura!<br>MESSAGE TEXT:<br>Dear Nobody,<br>I feel embarrassed now, thinking about following Laura out of the pump station like a kicked puppy, wondering what horrible thing I might have done, until she threw herself into this room and shut the door behind her and just screamed. The fear of abandonment is weirdly self-centered. Because it pre-supposes that little-old-you are filled with such immense destructive power that you're capable of driving every person you care about away.<br>Anyway, at the bottom of the dam, with her on side of the door and me on the other, she told me that Metallurgic had bought her mom's house\u2014her  whole neighborhood, in fact\u2014out from under her to build a new server farm.<br>\"Ugh, god, I don't even like that house,\" she said. \"I don't even like Indianapolis. I hated every minute I spent in that city as a kid. When they told us we'd have to leave the dam, I went back to my apartment, and sat on my bed, and I prayed to a god I don't even believe in that I wouldn't have to move back home, that I wouldn't have to show up on my mom's front stoop with a suitcase and a bunch of stupid excuses. \"She was trying not to sound like she was crying. But she sounded like she was crying. \"I guess I got my stupid wish, huh?\"<br>I asked her where she'd go, and she laughed. Where else could she go? Back home, to help her mom pack up the house, to move with her into whatever dank little one-room hole Metallurgic's \"displacement grant\" will allow them to afford. \"I think I could have dealt with being one of those losers who celebrate their fortieth birthday living in the house they grew up in. But now? Now I don't even have that.\"<br>I had no idea how to make her feel better. So I just sat on the other side of the door, and I started singing the song we were working on. The one about being the last two girls on earth. And eventually, she started singing along.<br>Love,<br>Shelly<br>",

We could practice in holospace.<br><b>SHELLY:</b> People always say that.<br>MESSAGE TEXT:<br>Dear Nobody,<br>We got in a fight. Laura and I. After practice, we went out for drinks. There's this Robar in downtown Cody, so we called an autocar and shuttled over. We were the only people there. With the park closing, Cody's becoming a ghost town.<br>The more we drank, the more passive-aggressive our banter became, snowballing out of our control, metastasizing in the empty air between us, and then before either of us really knew what was happening, we were yelling at each other. I kept thinking, like, I'm not abandoning her, she's abandoning me. And I guess she was probably thinking something similar.<br>We got quiet for a while. Drank more. Eventually Laura ordered an autocar, and we piled into it, slid as far from each other on the back seat as we could, arms crossed, staring out the window. And then I heard myself talking. \"Screw it. I don't care if you stay in touch with me. I'm going to stay in touch with you. Whether you like it or not, you're not getting rid of me. Ever.\"<br>Laura looked at me for what felt like ages. I thought she was going to start yelling. But then her hand crept over mine, and we just sat there together.<br>Bottoms up,<br>Shelly <br>",

    "<b>KENNY CHAU:</b> One last exchange with Anita, via chat - attached to this entry, in case anyone ever finds this.<br>I'll never see her again. Neither will CYAN. And I've got to tell her that, too.<br>PERSONAL LOG:<br>After I put the pieces together about the swarm, there's a million things I could have done: Contemplated my own death, contacted everyone I've ever known and loved, gotten drunk. But, of course, being me, I obsessed about whether or not I should text Anita.<br>Whatever resistance is being mounted against the war machines, she's part of it. Who am I, then, to bother her? Would she even be able to respond? If she's dealing with the military, would her communications be monitored? <br>But she saved me the trouble. Gotta admit, I was a little disappointed when her message didn't consist of \"I will always love you.\" Instead, she wanted data samples from CYAN's confidential log, the one that pertains to emotional responses. Under any other circumstances, I would have refused. The very thing we had tried to keep secret for years, and she wants to share it?<br>But I sent the log, because she wouldn't ask if she didn't need it. I can't understand why, though. Sounds like she's helping to develop an AI, but how could that possibly help stop the swarm?<br>I guess I'll never know.<br>There was so much I wanted to say to her, but none of it seemed fair. I'm guessing she has her hands full trying to save the world, and frankly, I remember that feeling.<br>In the end, I settled for an ineffectual confirmation, hoping against hope that she would cast aside my fears. Nope.<br><b>KENNY:</b> Is it as bad as I think it is?<br><b>ANITA:</b> Worse.<br><b>ANITA:</b> Go be with your sister, and tell CYAN that I said goodbye.<br>So that's it. Untold destruction awaits. Billions of lives. My own, my family's. And yet my mind keeps coming back to Anita. I'll never see her again, feel her touch, hear her voice. No final embrace, no closure.<br>That desire to end things properly, that need, shames me when I think about my dithering over CYAN. I've gone over every possible scenario, every possible version of the speech, trying to predict how she'll react when I tell her... well, what I need to tell her.<br>But that's the thing - I can't predict her reaction for one very simple reason: She's human, in every way that matters.<br>I've got to be there for her, to give her the moment she needs. Just like the rest of us, it's the very least she deserves.<br>",
    "<b>KENNY CHAU:</b> I thought about just shutting it down, but I can\u2019t risk it being disoriented - or even damaged - on reboot.<br>How do you tell the emotional equivalent of a child that it\u2026 I mean, she\u2026 will need to go into a coma, maybe for years?<br>And what exactly is she going to wake up to?<br>",
    "<b>KENNY CHAU:</b> November 28th. Operation Enduring Victory is all over the news. The Faro swarm is coming.<br>Has to be what Anita is trying to hide Firebreak from. But that means she thinks we\u2019ll lose, that the swarm will reach Yellowstone.<br>My God. In that scenario, pretty much everyone dies. Everyone except CYAN.<br>",
    "<b>ANITA SANDOVAL:</b> How am I going to explain to Kenny that Firebreak is doomed without a guiding intelligence advanced enough not only to think, but to feel?<br>PERSONAL LOG:<br>Oh-point-six. What does it meant to quantify an intelligence, anyway? You can\u2019t just assign a number on a continuum to a conscious mind and then expect it to obey whatever arbitrary limit that number represents.<br>There\u2019s no way around it. Without the supervision of a mind beyond human capacities, Firebreak is going to fail. And oh-point-six won\u2019t cut it, either. By pushing sentience, you inevitably generate a system that can experience emotion. Wild, sloppy, unmanageable emotion. You\u2019re capable of abstract thought, you\u2019re capable of fear. Like Vast Silver.<br>I won\u2019t go through that again. I categorically refuse.<br>Hopefully I can get this all across to Kenny. I like him. I like his lopsided little smile. I especially like those circles he makes with his hands when he gets excited about an idea. If we hadn\u2019t been flung together like this, maybe he and I\u2026 Well, no point in woolgathering.<br>I wonder, could an artificial brain experience this singular combination of desire and preemptive regret?<br>"
