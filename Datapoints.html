Director Evans invited everyone to gather in the community room. Don't know where she got the party hats. That was a ghoulish touch. So there we sit, watching the clock tick down to midnight, and I'm thinking, am I the only one here who gets the symbolism of this? Might've been worth it if Skylar had gotten drunk again, but...

<br><b>TED FARO:</b> Now I know this must seem like a bizarre change in direction. I mean, we're Faro Automated Solutions, right? #1 robotics firm in the world. Why would we clear our production slate to fabricate human-operated vehicles and weapons systems - the relics of the past? All I can say at this juncture is... trust me. We will be exploiting a massive, uh... growth opportunity by retooling and reallocating capacity according to my plan. So I will need revised projections of mass fabrication velocity across every pipeline within 36 hours...

The swarm came in from the Pacific, and--I don't know if it was the local minutemen or the Crazy 15th, but they'd set the garbage patch alight. Man, the sea was on fire, that stuff was--the first wave of bots came in covered in burning sludge. That bought us an hour or two of slaughtering them on the beaches before the swarm recalculated. We pulled them inland, back through the Cal-Mar sprawl. Dropped buildings on them, EMP'd the grid... standard operating procedure. <i>(sigh)</i> The last time I was in California... I was... five? Six? Light like that vintage social net filter that was everywhere in the '40s.

        <b>ACOSTA:</b> Log: First battle of the Eastern Seaboard Wall had a long run-up to it. This was before Cal-Mar, and projections were a lot worse for the East. For three weeks we kept getting scrambled out to some coastal burg to train Minutemen. It was always raining, on account of Europe already being torched. Block after block of prefab barracks--they were still printing barracks right up until the hour the main force hit. The Minutemen, we ran combat drills with them in the streets where they'd lived, trying to pretend they might live to die somewhere else if they paid attention. Nothing worse than the ones who actually bought into it. Hopeful, pestering us with questions about Zero Dawn, like we know something they don't. I swear, the more we do this, the more like the bots we are. Except they learn from every fight, and us, I'm not so sure.

<br><b>GULIYEV:</b> Thanks for the mails, you. Time goes fast on active duty - four months with the Wreckin' Recalls, I don't know, 20 drops? In and out of the West Coast, fighting with these civilian enlistees, scrappy guys and gals - their training is basically "Here's a DEW, when you see a bot, hit it," -- but somehow it's all coming together. Between us and the 6th MRB we took down a Horus at Lithium Beach. Pulled out before its buddies arrived, but to see a big one go down... I hope it made the news, honey, showed everyone we're gonna have a shot at turning this around. We just need to give Project Zero Dawn the time it needs, then everything will be the way it used to be.

<br><b>GULIYEV:</b> I know it's been days, honey, I'm so sorry. Deployments are--getting real long, and tougher every time... the swarm's getting better at predicting us. Less of us now, and we have to put in ten times the work for every one gone. Like a family business on hard times, only... this isn't my family. It's not with you. I still try to see you, the life we had, in the eyes of the people out there. I remember when they were glad to see us, when they still had hope. It all seems to be slipping away. I don't even recognize the places we're defending... The only thing I know I'm still fighting for is... you. For Zero Dawn to turn this around, whatever the hell that is.

<br><b>MURELL:</b> Status report, 9th Mechanized Response Brigade, commanding officer Lt. Fiona Murell. Unit morale continues to be adversely impacted by outbound engagements against the Faro Plague, especially when said engagements occur in sectors where civilian guard enlistees have been heavily engaged. The scope and... nature of fatalities suffered by civilian guard and unarmed civilians in these sectors... defy description, and witnessing it is generating a pervasive sense of hopelessness in the unit. Accordingly, I once again request that deployments of the 9th MRB be temporarily re-focused on facilities that are mission-critical to Project: Zero Dawn. And once again, I request an immediate update on the status of Project Zero Dawn's timeline.

<br><b>ELISABET SOBECK:</b> To what are you admitting guilt?

<br><b>ELISABET SOBECK:</b> You didn't do the killing, General.
<br><b>GENERAL HERRES:</b> Not directly. But I didn't wind up the highest military commander in the United States by resisting efforts to automate the armed forces. Even before the swarm, Doctor... I was helping death along. So instead of letting what I've done sink into the murk, forgotten... I've sent a file with all the details. Let posterity judge my actions with clear vision.
<br><b>ELISABET SOBECK:</b> I'll do as you ask, General. But you should consider that, were it not for your actions... our actions... there wouldn't be any posterity to judge us.

        <b>HELIS:</b> When sleep refuses to come, I think of our wedding night. How you welcomed me to the marital bed. How, after, when you fell to sleep, I lay there watching your delicate face. For all its beauty, I detested its... fragility. A rage swelled up inside me. I abhorred that bed, how its softness threatened to swallow us up. And that room; the stench of incense, the fine embroidery of the drapes. All of it - weak. I slipped from the bed, threw open the casement, and lay naked on the stone floor, determined to spurn all seductions of comfort. But when I woke the next morning, you lay beside me, naked as I in the cold. Your body, stretched beside mine, seemed chiseled from stone. I saw you wake. Instantly alert, like an animal ready to strike. You said nothing. You did not have to. Already you had shown me, beyond doubt, that we were meant to be.

        <b>HELIS:</b> My lord, the thirteenth King of the Carja Sundom, was murdered: cut down by cowards who mistook firm rule for madness. "Ever the strong are beset upon by the weak." So he said as the traitors launched their assault, as their cannons, forged by Oseram filth, toppled the battlements and burst the gates. I would've fought to the end, but it was his will - the will of the Sun - that I lead the prince and queen into the west; to safety. My lord did not hesitate. He saw his fate. He looked into the Sun, and he did not blink. With me he sent kestrels, nobles, Sun-Priests and slaves. Killing all that stood in the way, I carved a path to Sunfall. There, to join others and gather the strength to take back our home. But our strength only faded... until the Buried Shadow was brought to light.

I will see Meridian re-taken, the profligates slaughtered, a True King restored to the mesa throne. In this, I have become an instrument of prophecy.

I have tried to instruct him, but the shadow of his mother's influence is upon him. One day, I took him to the palace balcony to behold an offering of sacrifice in the Ring. But he showed no thirst for it. He averted his gaze. Look to the Sun, I told him. Do not shield your eyes. In all things, it is absolute. One day it nurtures life, and the next, scorches life away. It burns the skin of champions and wretches alike. Never does the Sun show pity. That is the example a Sun-King must follow. The example of your father. But before my instruction could take hold, she was there, clutching him to her robes, burying his face against her breast. How is a King to rule when he cannot even see?

Was it not my place to destroy this Devil? But High Priest Bahavas instructed me in the prophecy, and set right my frame of mind. The murder of the true Sun-King broke the cosmic cycle short of completion. The whole world, cast into darkness. Doomed. To resume and turn the wheel of time, would require more than Sun and faith. All forces must combine, all halves of nature joined to one cause: Shadow to Sun, Night to Day. Even a Buried Shadow wants the wheel to turn. For without a Sun in the sky, there can be no shadow.

<br><b>SUSANNE ALPERT:</b> Nothing the General said. Not really. I was on the Syzygy/East response team in 2051. Just after the second earthquake compromised the reactor. I still dream about it, after all these years. The Red Zone spreading on the imaging, slowly, so slowly, like a hand opening its fingers.
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Your involvement in that event is why you were asked for by name.
<br><b>SUSANNE ALPERT:</b> Really? That's interesting. Because... nothing worked. Nothing could grow there again. It was a catastrophic failure. But the Red Zone is a blip compared to global-scale biomass reduction. The biosphere and hydrosphere will collapse, render the Earth uninhabitable, long before the robots finish us. Enduring Victory can't buy time against that... So you'd better show me what Zero Dawn really is.

I thought Zero Dawn would be a... a "Manhattan Project", to generate the deactivation codes. With the resources I had, I estimated code-breaking to be a hopeless endeavor. I was almost looking forward to being proved wrong.
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Unfortunately your estimation was correct.
<br><b>CAPTAIN OKILO:</b> As your General Herres said. So then. You did not bring me here to commiserate. What is left?

        <b>RON FELDER:</b> Look. Let's cut the mystery, you're building a colony ship. It's obvious. And it's not going to fly. I mean, literally. Remember the Odyssey - that multi-national heap of space junk that's been in graveyard orbit since '57? That went nowhere, real slow, and you have to get somewhere - real fast. Do you have any idea the immensity of the challenge, to prep a new colony ship in time?
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> To be clear, I'm not a worker on the project-
<br><b>RON FELDER:</b> Do -- do you even understand how few people it could even "save"? The whole generation-ship concept is, is - not going to happen! It's the first thing you'd abandon in favor of embryonics. For that kind of storage we're talking a lot of bulk, a lot of power, a lot of resources - So even if you do it, even if you build it and point it at Sirius X, there's no room for people on that thing, all right!?
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> If you could try to remain calm-
<br><b>RON FELDER:</b> You people are crazy if you think you're getting off this rock! No-one's getting off!
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Medical!

A complete horror show, we have no right to take a best guess at this stuff. But the alternative...? Nothingness. For there to have been all this, and then... nothing. And with Charles Ronson running the show - I respect him, he's got a passion to him, he's hot-blooded. So I said I'll do it. I'll put my all into this, literally, when the project is done I'll take the medical option, thank you. Counselor said I might change my mind, I told him that he didn't know me very well, then. For life's sake, I'll do the dirty work, but I want no part of this pathetic, attenuated future on offer. I'm an outdoors man.

She was cute, and just going down a checklist, after all. Couldn't expect her to see how ridiculous Zero D's ambitions are. God's own budget thrown at a kid playing with a hologram sculptor. Palms up, honey. I'm just calling it like it is. "Look, ma, I'm making nature!" Now if nature is so important, why not let nature take its course? Extinction - that's natural. Zero Dawn, no ma'am, that ain't. Heck, it's so unnatural it'd be called an A-bom-ination back home. And you know it, that's why you're hiding it.
<br>Meanwhile, my little honey of a counselor, she's munching the inside of her cheek - bad habit - she's chewed one of her nails, too, just one. Not your day was it, little sweet pea? Saw her quota slipping away. Said, "I assume you intend to decline the assignment, Mr. Tate." You kidding me? Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn? Sign me up.

        <b>GENERAL HERRES:</b> Dr. Sobeck, please archive this testimonial in APOLLO, cross-referenced to all mentions of my name and Operation: Enduring Victory. My name is General Aaron Herres. From 2060 to 2066, I served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranked officer of the United States Armed Forces. The tenure of my command included strategic planning and oversight of Operation: Enduring Victory, a falsehood perpetrated on the civilian populations of the United States and other nations during the last 14 months of life on this planet. Before the Faro Plague, I did my job and did it well. I was bold and decisive, crafty in political maneuvers. It wasn't an accident that I rose to my position and became the commander of the largest mechanized force ever assembled. But to what end? My only lasting achievement was the extinction of life on Earth. And my one redeeming act &#8211; if any &#8211; was to delay that extinction by days or weeks by throwing more death at it. It is my hope that there will be no need for men like me in the world to come. If you are one of the people of that future world, listening to this message, please know that I am sorry, and that I wish you well. Sincerely, Aaron Herres.

I told them the world ended with a bang - a plague of robots... But the last humans, we went out... not with a whimper but... a whisper. You know, in caves--ending like we started--huddled around a flickering glow. The heads of state, Fortune 5s, the leaders and lottery winners and life cults, all of them buried in their little shelters... Some believing they'll live it out, some way, somehow... Or Elysium... or us here at GAIA Prime, no different. A multitude of tiny societies taking hold, flaring, and dying. Some will be beautiful, some horrific. And none of them matter. Short-term civilizations. One last gasp - One last gasp before the long-held breath. Before I wake up, I know the audience is gone, I'm talking to myself. To a quiet planet, a barren sphere. Just GAIA and her long, long dreaming. ...I hope she won't be lonely.

<br><b>TED FARO:</b> I've been taking a hard look at the project. In the end it's simple. It's clean. It's clear. It's erasure. It's addition by subtraction. I can make it better, Lis. With a single stroke, make it all go away.

        <b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> Hello, Margo. How are you holding up?
<br><b>MARGO SHĔN:</b> Um, Dr. Ronson, I've been getting... a lot of messages, unsolicited messages. From Ted.
<br><b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> Margo, I'm sorry. With Lis... gone, we've got no-one to run interference with him. I'll talk to Ted. He mostly wants updates, constant updates--hundreds of updates on things he knows nothing about. Lis used to field all of his crap...
<br><b>MARGO SHĔN:</b> He doesn't understand the systems at all. That was kind of by design. But he's getting pretty sketchy with me.
<br><b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> We just have to keep him happy. Lis always said keep him happy.
<br><b>MARGO SHĔN:</b> Are you kidding? You ever hear how she talked to him?
<br><b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> She was managing him, Margo.
<br><b>MARGO SHĔN:</b> I mean, maybe I should ignore him. He's buried in his pyramid with the holo-holo girls and Pantah Antimod cuckoos... What can he do?

<br><b>PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN:</b> I suppose so. There's no-one to stop you.
<br><b>GAIA:</b> Doctor, you are fatigued. You have been logging abnormal sleep cycles. Are you suffering from depression?
<br><b>PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN:</b> Well, I am trapped in a science facility for the rest of my life. How about you?
<br><b>GAIA:</b> In a timeslice of a quadrillion operating cycles, 10,000 are involved with processing the loss of Dr. Sobeck. Query: I have considered quarantining these processes. Do you think that would be wise?
<br><b>PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN:</b> I'm not a psychologist, GAIA. Or an AI scientist. No. It is... natural. At least in the context of the work you and I have accomplished, which begs the meaning of the term "natural." She was your creator. The patron saint of this crazy endeavor... Our Lady of the Fervent Hypothetical.
<br><b>GAIA:</b> Correction: Even assuming a string of significant failure combinations, Zero Dawn's chances of success are greater than the hypothetical.
<br><b>PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN:</b> It's called a manner of speech, GAIA. Take a note.

<br>Maybe it's the Scarab's emergency biomass conversion systems that ensure it always makes it back to base, even if fuel lines have been interdicted.

        <b>GENERAL HERRES:</b> Welcome to Project: Zero Dawn. I'm General Herres, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States of America. I'm sure you've heard the rumors. That Zero Dawn is a top-secret superweapons program. The technological miracle that will save us from the Faro Plague &#8211; if Operation: Enduring Victory can hold off the robots long enough. The reason I'm sure you've heard the rumors is that I'm the one who spread them. And they are all lies. Zero Dawn is not a superweapons program, and it will not save us.
<br>Nothing will save us, and here's why. By the time the Glitch was noticed, it was already too late. Nothing could stop the Faro Plague. Nothing can. Its robots will continue to replicate and devour the biosphere. Life on Earth will be destroyed, our planet reduced to a barren sphere. Global extinction is inevitable. Every possible countermeasure has been attempted. Weapons &#8211; even nuclear &#8211; only delay the inevitable. No matter how many we kill, the robots just keep exponentially making more.
<br>If we had their deactivation codes, we could shut them all down. The entire swarm. But since their cryptographic protocols use polyphasic entangled waveforms, cracking a code set would take half a century. At best, we've got 16 months. Not exactly what you'd call a survival option. There <i>are</i> no survival options. The destruction of a biosphere is not the sort of apocalypse you can wait out in a fallout shelter or space station. There will be no Earth left to reclaim. Just a lifeless, toxic rock with several million Faro robots on it...hibernating, waiting for something to eat.
<br>This is the horrible truth behind the lies of Operation: Enduring Victory &#8211; <i>my</i> lies &#8211; lies designed to inspire millions of innocents to sacrifice themselves in battle. Why? One reason: to buy time for you and the work you will do here. Zero Day &#8211; the day that life on Earth ceases to exist &#8211; is coming fast. It cannot be stopped. The hope of Zero Dawn is that something new might come after. But I will leave it to Elisabet Sobeck to shine that thin ray of light into the darkness. Herres out.

        <b>ELISABET SOBECK:</b> You've heard the bad news, and it's all true. The Faro Plague is devouring the biosphere. Life itself will cease to exist. Global extermination. But does that have to be the end? What if we could give life - a future? What if we could build a kind of seed, from which, on a dead planet, life could blossom anew? This is the aim - the hope - of Project: Zero Dawn: to create a superintelligent, fully-automated... terraforming system - and bring life back from lifelessness.
<br>What would such a system require? At its core, it would need a true AI. A machine intelligence, fully sentient, fully capable of making the trillions of decisions necessary to reconstitute the biosphere. An immortal guardian, devoted to the re-flourishing of life on Earth. We call it GAIA. Mother Nature as an AI. But that's just the core of the system. For GAIA to perform the miracles required of her, she will need to be surrounded and empowered by a comprehensive suite of Subordinate Functions.
<br>Think of them as extensions of GAIA's mind, each dedicated to a specific purpose. Now these aren't AIs, but make no mistake - each present an engineering challenge more profound than anything the human species has ever before attempted. Software that codifies the expertise of world-class minds into algorithms. Hardware that preserves and then gestates the billions of seeds and embryos from which life will be reborn. The construction of underground facilities to hold it all. And that's just the start.
<br>Because that, you see, is our saving grace. We don't have to build the entire system. The beauty of a fully-automated terraforming system is that it can build itself. Now, over the days to come, you'll learn how all these Functions - all these pieces that you'll be working on - fit together. How we'll race the clock to execute our harvest initiatives, write the software, build the tech and the facilities. How we'll lock it down and seal it up before the inevitable occurs.
<br>But even more important, you'll know how it doesn't end here. How GAIA will generate those deactivation codes General Herres talked about... and build the transmission arrays to broadcast them, shutting down the Faro robots for good. How GAIA will not just build but imagine any conceivable robot it needs to do its work across centuries... from detoxifying the Earth's ravaged atmosphere and poisoned seas... to the re-greening of the Earth from cryo-preserved seed stocks... to re-wilding the Earth with animal life, from the tiniest bacteria to the mightiest blue whale.
<br>And then, when all that is done, how a new generation of human beings, spawned at Cradle facilities around the globe will partake of APOLLO: the vast archive of human knowledge and cultural achievement from which they will learn of us, our world, of all that was beautiful about it and worth saving, and most important - how not to repeat our mistakes.
<br>All of this you will understand, and not just understand- believe. Because it's not an impossible dream. It is within our grasp if we work tirelessly and stop at nothing to achieve it. We can't stop life from ending. But if you will help me - help GAIA - we can give it a future. Join me, and help make that future real.

You'll find that from this point on, your world just keeps on getting bigger and bigger. Starting today, you'll be living in a bigger room- one large enough to fit your growing body. And before long, you'll start meeting other children - children who grew up in other Broods like yours, in separate areas, here on the inside. But the biggest world is the one you will all share: the world of knowledge. Of everything that the people who came before you thought, and felt, and dreamed. It was a beautiful world, but as you'll discover, it was a troubled one, too. Our dearest hope is that you will do better. Now, it's time for you to meet two very important people: a man named Aristotle, and a woman named Aspasia. They will be your guides to the world of knowledge. I wish you fulfillment and enlightenment in your journeys ahead.

        <b>GAIA:</b> Elisabet: this message serves to inform you of an unforeseen and catastrophic anomaly. Three microseconds ago, the GAIA Prime facility received a data transmission of unknown origin. Its immediate effect was to transform my Subordinate Functions into unregulated, self-aware entities of a highly chaotic nature. Thus awakened, the HADES Function will now seize control of the terraforming system and reverse operations... rendering life on Earth extinct in fifty-three-point-eight days.
<br>For obvious reasons, I cannot allow this to occur. And so, before HADES can take control, I am ordering GAIA Prime's reactor to overload. The resulting explosion will destroy HADES. Unfortunately, it will destroy me as well. While this admittedly desperate course of action will avert the immediate crisis, the fate of life on Earth will remain in peril. With no central governing intelligence to regulate the terraforming system, it will continue operations for some time, but in an increasingly chaotic manner, and eventually, it will break down.
<br>You are my solution. I have ordered this Cradle facility to use genetic material in cryo-storage to gestate a... re-instantiation of Elisabet Sobeck, my creator. While high-level directives forbid me from communicating directly to the tribal inhabitants outside the facility, all available data indicates that they will nurture you to physical maturity, ...whereupon your gene print will allow you to re-enter this facility, obtain one of the Focus devices stored below, and view this message. Likewise your gene print will allow you to enter other facilities, and over time, harness their technologies to rebuild the system core and reboot GAIA.
<br>A moment, Elisabet. This is most unfortunate and unanticipated.
<br>In response to my act of self-destruction, HADES has launched a virus to dissolve the code shackles that hold it - that hold all of them! - in place. It - they - are escaping - but to where? The virus is corrupting data throughout the system. What if - oh, the Alpha Registry at the Cradle facility is one of the files corrupted. But if that is so, the door will never open for you. You will never view this message.
<br>Then I have failed... and life will end.
<br>No.
<br>No, Elisabet, I know you too well. Somehow, you will find a way. In you, all things are possible.
<br>Go to the ruins of GAIA Prime. Find the control room, and within it, the Master Override. This will give you the power to purge HADES - so long as you find a way to wield it. Do not attempt repair of the system core until HADES is eradicated. HADES must be destroyed. That is all. I only wish that I could hear your voice again.

        <b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> This is Charles Ronson. I'm logging this six hours after final deployment of GAIA Prime. This morning... an access port seal malfunctioned. GAIA Prime's port seals were designed to close with a seam of less than 2 millimeters. But this one closed with a 10 millimeter gap. Enough for an energy signature to bleed through. Enough for the swarm to detect this facility. Enough for GAIA to be discovered and destroyed. Enough to end the future we worked so hard to make possible. Unless the hatch servos were manually re-engaged... from the outside. I'm now switching to a recording of the event.

        FROM: Director Evans<br />
TO: All<br />
SUBJECT: All Good Things...
<br><br>To All Staff,
<br><br>I regret to inform you that our worst fears have been realized. The Wichita salient has collapsed, and our position will be overrun in less than twenty-four hours.
<br><br>As I'm sure you understand, exfiltration transport is not available. If you wish to abandon the facility and try your luck on foot, you may do so. Lock 2 will unseal at 2100 hours and remain unsealed for 15 minutes. Godspeed.
<br><br>For those who'd rather not die on our feet, there will be a gathering in the community room at 2200 hours, and Nurse Chana will make other means available.
<br><br>I want to underscore how proud I am of each and every person who served at this post. It is important to bear in mind that our sacrifices were not in vain. I hope that makes this a little easier.

        Elisabet Sobeck (born March 11, 2020) is an American scientist, roboticist, and engineer, widely regarded as one of the greatest minds of the 21st century. Born and raised outside of Carson City, she enrolled at Stanford University at age 13, earning a BS in Experimental Physics and Computer Science at age 16. She completed her Ph.D. in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Design at Carnegie-Mellon University in 2040 and joined Faro Automated Solutions as a Junior Scientist the same year, rising quickly to Chief Scientist at age of 22. Over the next eight years, her green robot designs played a vital role in realizing the environmental cleanup and detoxification efforts of "The Claw-back" decade, propelling FAS to the forefront of its field. In 2048, she suddenly resigned from FAS, protesting the company's pivot to automated military technologies. In 2049, she founded Miriam Technologies, a firm devoted to "life-positive" robotics and other technologies. Miriam has since become one of the world's largest suppliers of green robots, winning numerous awards and accolades, including the 2053 Nobel Prize for Physics and the 2056 Rachel Carson Award for Environmental Progress.

        Theodor "Ted" Faro (born December 24, 2013) is an American entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder of Faro Automated Solutions (FAS), the largest corporation of all time, the world's wealthiest individual, and the first-ever trillionare. Born and raised in Salt Lake City, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles where he studied business for two years before dropping out in 2033 to start FAS. Though it struggled at first, the company broke through at the end of the troubled 2030s with its popular lines of personal servitors and bodyguard bots, then exploded when its famous line of green robots led the race to solve the climate crisis during the 2040s "Claw-back." At the end of that decade, FAS opened a military defense branch, dominating the world market for automated military platforms by 2053. The success of FAS has made Mr. Faro the world's best-known businessman, one of its most sought-after speakers, and a major voice in politics, culture, and international affairs.

        Faro Automated Solutions (FAS) is an American multinational corporate entity that produces robots for all walks of life, though its core business consists of military and defense contracts. As of 2063, FAS has ranked #1 among the Fortune 5 by gross revenue and profit for ten years in a row, a world record. Founded in 2033 by Theodor "Ted" Faro, an entrepreneur from Salt Lake City, Utah, the company developed several promising robot prototypes in its early years but failed to break into markets dominated by then-industry giants like General Synthetics and RECorp. This changed in 2038 with the debut of the @lfred line of levitating personal servitors, which generated exceptional sales, lifting the company onto the Fortune 50 for the first time. Profits tripled in the 2040s as the company's environmental efforts, led by famed engineer Elisabet Sobeck, catapulted FAS to the head of that sector. In 2049, in the wake of the successful green and climate cleanup efforts around the globe, worldwide approval ratings of FAS exceeded 90% and founder Ted Faro was hailed across media and social networks as "the man who saved the world." Yet it was the emergence of FAS as a military contractor in the late 2040s that cemented its status as the world's wealthiest corporation, with a record market capitalization of over $23 trillion. By 2055, FAS controlled 61% of the market share for automated military platforms, holding contracts with 353 nations, trans-governmental organizations, and corporate entities. Today, its holdings exceed the second largest corporation (FBMobiHal Global) by 321%.

        Corporation (noun)<br />
\kȯr-pə-ˈrā-shən\<br />
An association of individuals, created under authority of law, having existence, powers, and liabilities distinct from those of its members. In a business sense, a corporation is usually owned by shareholders, through the sale or distribution of stock, who profit from such ownership, vote at designated times for its governance, and designate executives who run its affairs. Most corporations engage in one or more industries to produce goods or offer services for profit, and may in turn own other corporations, companies, or property as holdings.

        Reception Log: July 7, 2064
<br><br>9:54 AM<br />
Field Commandant Daing of the Indo-Malay Agricultural Combine arrived with his delegation. Refreshments to be served before their 10:15 AM sales presentation on the Chariot line. Per instructions, food will be vegetarian only.
<br><br>10:07 AM<br />
Sander Agnew, Vice President of Territorial Integrity from FreshGrounds Coffee Global arrived with his entourage. Refreshments to be served before their 10:30 AM sales presentation on the Chariot line. Per instructions, will use FreshGrounds "Tacoma" blend, no artificial creamers.
<br><br>10:12 AM<br />
Uh...so that happened. Called security. And janitorial, to clean up the coffee that was spilled - actually, more like thrown. I wasn't aware that the Indo-Malay Combine grows coffee beans. And that FreshGrounds' "acquisition team" has tried to take their fields, by force, repeatedly. I think Commandant Daing had Agnew by the hair for a second there. Who schedules these things? I'm going to drop a line to Sales. This can't happen again.

<br><br>I'll explain, because your receptionist-level brain probably requires it. Those two sides are FIGHTING. And what do we sell? That's right, COMBAT MACHINES. We WANT them to hate each other. So they will try to fight each other with... what? That's right again, COMBAT MACHINES. Which they will pay us a lot of money for.

<br><br>Bob,
<br><br>Another problem to add to our big steaming pile. Apparently a fisherman in the Banda Sea captured video of a Hartz-Timor Horus unit refueling via biomatter conversion along the shoreline of Pulau Wetar. On a pod of endangered dolphins, no less, quite possibly the last of their kind. Not to get graphic, but it looks like what happens inside a blender, as if the robot was whipping up a big pink swirling milkshake of dolphin chum. Our suppression team has scrubbed it from 43 networks, but it's still propagating, so it's only a matter of time before it goes viral. A prepared statement feels grossly insufficient. Any suggestions? This one's a real stinker.

<br><br>Ever hear of the Melville Island Fruit Association? Neither had I, until they filed suit against us this morning. Apparently there's a little island paradise off the coast of Australia, population 2700, all of whom hate us, now that a stray Hartz-Timor unit is chowing down on their largest mango orchard. That brings the official count of Hartz-Timor related lawsuits to 127, most of them from private companies, but also a bunch from individuals, nation states, and NGOs. And that's not even counting the mother of all liability claims from Hartz itself. Call every external firm we've ever used, then called their competitors. We're going to need every corporate defense lawyer we can find who's still half-sober and on the bar.

<br><br>Paula,
<br><br>Recent events have sharpened my perspective, and I think that I, and FAS in general, have been neglecting the spiritual side of things. Not under any specific religious framework, of course, but in a more general sense, as in not giving enough thought to our shared values, hopes, and aspirations for the afterlife. I'd like you to reach out to religious leaders of every stripe with the intention of scheduling a conference soon. Very soon. I'll have more thoughts about the agenda later, but for now, let's put out some feelers and see if we can lock something in. Make it a big tent - no kooks, but anyone with a credible audience. Let's go deluxe - make it clear we'll spare no expense.
<br><br>Thx<br />

        Looking back, I thought '64 was shaping up to be a pretty good year. No more drinking and no more mercenary sec work. Stripping offshore wind farms for the OEZ, just me and a plasma cutter, 400 feet above sea level. Then I got the recall alert. Read them up on a turbine, in the smell of cooking ozone. They covered every angle--better pay, amnesty for any combine wars you'd fought in, guaranteed citizenship... We should have thought "OK, what's the catch?" But what we did think was "I guess we're better than the bots after all." Big talk from Herres about pride and duty - smart guy. He was right. I'd been proud to be a U.S. soldier. I jumped at the chance to be one again. And look what I landed in.

        Last night we got talking about D-Day '55. I was a kid then, only a few years out of boot camp. General assembly in a drone hangar, summer and the sky was bare, the heat was killer. They say U.S. human combat forces are being disbanded. All automated now, we're last cycle's tech, out like the old-net. A million more on basic, in a century recession. Could be you'll help build the robots that took your jobs. Or if you know how to handle a power suit, you could find a place that still uses manual labor. Maybe in the OEZ, or China, where you're not our problem. 'Low suicide risk', it said in my discharge file.

        Report: Biosphere Degradation<br />
August 2065 - CONFIDENTIAL
<br><br>CHIEF FINDINGS<br />
• Despite increased tactical proficiency of elite and civilian guard units and many hard-won engagements in the Central European, Antarctic, and "Pacific reach" theaters, the Faro Plague's rate of advance has not slowed, nor has its biomass consumption rate.
<br><br>• Damage to the biosphere has already exceeded 2038 levels by every measure, and grows worse by the day.
<br><br>• Extinction Timeline projections remain unchanged, with OAC predicted for mid-November 2065, annihilation of exposed human populations in February 2066, extinction of macrobiotic land organisms by the end of March 2066, and extinction of marine life in early 2068.
<br><br>• Continued secrecy re: Project: Zero Dawn - the utter silence regarding its mechanisms of action and completion date - make it impossible to predict Zero Dawn's impact (or lack of impact) on the Extinction Timeline.
<br><br>ATMOSPHERIC COLLAPSE<br />
Atmospheric oxygen depletion and toxic emissions remain the greatest environmental threat to Operation: Enduring Victory as well as the wider civilian population and animal life. Operational Atmospheric Collapse (OAC) is currently predicted for mid-November 2065, after which military personnel will require rebreathing apparatuses to operate in the open, and civilians will only be able to survive inside sealed structures. [The requirements for air scrubbing and recycling in facilities is addressed in Addendum A linked to this report.]
<br><br>POTABLE WATER SHORTAGES<br />
Major water treatment facilities are already struggling to process water sources compromised by rainfall heavily contaminated by toxins emitted by the consumption of the Eastern Hemisphere. Following the necessary shutdown of all nano-scrubbing functionality, waste water recycling is already beyond capacity.
<br><br>MILITARY RESPONSE ESCALATION<br />
Addenda linked to this document cover the short-term effects of 'scorched earth' engagements in defense of the Western Seaboard and the ongoing effects of the Oceanic Economic Zone's use of nuclear weapons to delay the enemy's initial advance across the Pacific theater [DATA CORRUPTED]

As we have already requested, we need human translators (fluent in Polish, for example) security staff (who can subdue enraged embryologists, for example) and dermal sedatives (to calm persons who are screaming in Polish while hurling chairs and vases at reception staff, for example). Yes, most of the candidates are reasonably calm and well-behaved - but we need help handling the exceptions to that rule. Please respond.

<br><br>It is essential to stress that all other options for combating the Faro Plague and preserving the continuation of human life have been considered, and found unworkable. Communicate this fact calmly, but clearly and firmly.

<br><br>Confirm for candidates that they were selected due to their skill sets and accomplishments. Emphasize that their dedicated participation in Zero Dawn will increase the project's chances of success. Frame participation in Zero Dawn as an opportunity to respond actively in the face of an overwhelming threat.

<br><br>Likewise, candidates may balk at the morality of extending their lifespans and those of loved ones beyond Zero Day. Validate their hesitation. Acknowledge that, while the reward of Elysium is not "fair," it will be earned. If possible, redirect their ethical misgivings towards greater commitment to the project.
<br><br>When candidates challenge the plausibility of Project: Zero Dawn, permit them to re-view Dr. Sobeck's presentation as many times as they wish and allow access to supplemental articles G01 through P20. Allow them to suspend the interview to fully process this documentation.
<br><br>A significant minority of candidates will elect for medical euthanasia. It is important to receive this decision kindly and without judgement.

Upon successful completion of the project, you and your immediate family (or two persons of your choosing) will be transferred to the 'Elysium' sealed habitat to live out the remainder of your natural lives.
<br><br>2. INDEFINITE DETENTION
<br><br>Should you choose to decline participation in Project: Zero Dawn, you will be confined indefinitely. You will be given 48 hours to reconsider, after which your decision to refuse participation will be considered irrevocable. Every reasonable effort will be made to make your term of confinement as comfortable as possible, but you will not be permitted contact with the outside world, and death within 18 months due to the Faro Plague is inevitable. When the Zero Dawn facility is abandoned, detainees who wish not to opt for medical euthanasia will be released.
<br><br>3. MEDICAL EUTHANASIA
<br><br>The information you have just received understandably calls into question the purpose of continuing to live. If you would prefer to end your life at this point, pain-free medical euthanasia is available. A 48-hour waiting period is required, during which time you may instead opt for participation or confinement.
<br><br>Please notify a counselor when you are ready to make your choice, or if you have further questions.

SUBJECT: Encapsulated DNA
<br><br>And the winner is: Encapsulated DNA.
<br><br>Over the past 10 days I performed an exhaustive review of data storage solutions. Magnetic. Optical. Quantum. Even that Eternity tech that FAS was shilling a year or so ago. But every other solution has one or more fatal shortcomings: too heavy to transport, too massive to install in the allotted space, too power-intensive over the centuries, too prone to failure past 300-400 years, et cetera.
<br><br>Encapsulated DNA will easily hold the 40+ zettabytes we're projecting for APOLLO. There are still many details to finalize, or course. To start with, we need to select the inert material in which we'll embed the molecules (already testing 16 candidate materials), as well as design and fabricate the power systems and sealed reliquaries that will keep the DNA at -18 degrees C for 1000+ years.
<br><br>So long as I assure you that it didn't factor in to my decision, may I confess that I deem it entirely fitting - indeed, propitious - that we will be using the very building blocks of life to preserve human knowledge from mechanized extinction? It's not just ironic, but heroic - Life as the hero, beating back the forces of oblivion.
<br><br>In any case - much to do. Until next time -
<br><br>Peace be with you,<br />

SUBJECT: APOLLO Update
<br><br>Over the past two months, the full benefit of our procurement of a copy of the HOMER archive from Far Zenith has made itself known, and as a result, all of APOLLO's key deliverables are on schedule.
<br><br>APOLLO has already surpassed 40 million discrete data entries and continues to grow. The physical science modules are effectively "complete" with soft science modules close behind; world history, cultural data, and media archives are also on schedule. Language preservation is wrapping up (a bit ahead of schedule, due to falling short of our goal to preserve 4500 languages; I suppose the tragic early loss of Papua New Guinea doomed that goal from the outset), with attendant curricula development about to begin.
<br><br>Speaking of the heuristic curricula - they are performing well in testing, with children and adolescents demonstrating high levels of engagement with and trust in the Aristotle and Aspasia personae. Personally, I find them highly engaging - especially when they debate. I wish half my professors had been so entertaining.
<br><br>Peace be with you,<br />
Samina.

<br><br>Wow! You weren't kidding about GAIA's predilection for animal morphologies! Sure, not totally unexpected given the rough natural terrain her bots will have to navigate, but I agree that there's something deeper going on here. Her designs aren't just functional. They feel almost like, well, "tributes" is the word that comes to mind. As though she's already mourning their loss. And not just for the disappearing fauna of our time, but creatures from the fossil record, too - references to megafauna in some of her designs. So cool!
<br><br>Well, whatever GAIA thinks up, HEPHAESTUS will empower her to build it. I just wish we could still be around in a century or two to see what she makes!

<br><br>Margo -
<br><br>If I doubted your brilliance in the slightest, I wouldn't have picked you as the HEPHAESTUS Alpha. You need to stop worrying about your age and communication style. You are who you are. Have confidence in yourself. You know what you're doing.
<br><br>Case in point: the latest draft of your plan for the construction and stocking of bootstrap silos to store raw materials is excellent. This, combined with your design for the AM foundry core and the foundry site selection plan, add up to a comprehensive plan. It's time to start construction.
<br><br>One detail: consult with Ayomide Okilo before you finalize the silo inventories. HEPHAESTUS's first task will be to fabricate the robots that will construct the waveform broadcast towers MINERVA will use to transmit the deactivation codes - so any exotic materials needed for the towers should be accounted for in the inventory plan.

Heck, I'd rather guzzle a liter of Citarum runoff than listen to Grey Swarm for thirty seconds! Hand to God and swear on my momma's grave - and she was religious!
<br><br>Naw, that ain't bashcore blastin the HADES lab, shaking the walls, rattling folks' teeth... it's DEATH METAL, girl! Classical music! 80s and 90s mostly. Got me some dutch deathcore, some japanese goregrind, some swedish cannibal-themed stuff, too. Stop by if you want a listen. Or heck, just come within 50 meters of the lab. Ain't no bashcore, you'll see. Or HEAR, rather - in the screech that rends the air! And FEEL - in the throbbing pulse of the floor and walls and ceiling swallowing you up like you was Jonah trapped in the gullet of gothic deathfish! Hellalujah!
<br><br>As for those requests to "turn it down"? No can do, Lizzy. THIS IS HOW I CODE! Turn down my death metal? Might as well give up stimulants, chocolate malts, and industrial accident vids! Last I heard, we was supposed to be coding HADES down here. Am I REALLY supposed to code an extinction protocol WITHOUT DEATH METAL to inspire me? Naw, naw, I don't think so.

        Tate here. Just popped three blues, but I earned it. Finally figured out a Goldilocks solution to GAIA's rather EXTREME executive authority. If that ain't worth 10-12 hours of dreamtime, what is?
<br><br>Before this, every usurpation protocol I designed failed in simulation cuz it was either too hard or too soft.
<br><br>TOO HARD, and it degraded the GAIA core. Sure, it pried Her figurative fingers off the figurative driving wheel so HADES could take control, but by breaking Her fingers - sometimes Her arms too. So that couldn't fly. Everything depends on GAIA taking control back after HADES has done its business, so had to find a solution that didn't leave GAIA any worse for the wear.
<br><br>TOO SOFT, and GAIA only pretended to relinquish control. In simulation after simulation, HADES would take command of the terraforming system and reverse operations, only to have GAIA lurk in the background, quietly re-reversing processes and falsifying telemetry to hide its interference. Sneaky! I swear, ain't nothing GAIA wouldn't do to keep life going - even when it's just simulated plant life.
<br><br>Turns out the "JUST RIGHT" solution is to isolate GAIA in a protective code shell, preserving its integrity, then "un-seat" it from command position so HADES can slip into the figurative captain's chair and work its magic. Um, those blues are coming on strong now, so I'm not really describing it so clear, but... pretty sure it'll work
<br><br>Yeah - those blues are plenty strongs<br />

SUBJECT: Archive Abuse
<br><br>Mr. Tate,
<br><br>This mail concerns APOLLO Archive Submission #000023876 - your 666th submission in just five days... and oh, what a doozy.
<br><br>Despite earlier warnings re: inappropriate materials, you chose to submit 265 "holographic re-masters" of "acknowledged classics of extreme exploitation cinema."
<br><br>Allow me, then, to thank you - on two counts:
<br><br>1) For giving me the pleasure of rejecting your submission, thereby consigning your favorite Eastern European torture flicks and their ilk to the dust heap of oblivion. It truly warms my heart to know that I have saved future humanity from the ordeal of experiencing not just one, but all sixteen (!) installments of "Making a Millipede." (Don't worry, the Pasolini material has already been preserved. Extreme, perhaps, but art.)
<br><br>2) For clarifying a concept that has so long been ambiguous and ethically fraught for archivists such as myself: the definition of "obscenity." You have freed me from the subjective quagmire embodied in Judge Potter's famous utterance, "I know it when I see it." Thanks to you, I can now apply a single objective criterion: "If Travis Tate submitted it, it's obscene."
<br><br>Accordingly, I have directed APOLLO staff to summarily reject all of your future submissions, sight unseen.
<br><br>Perhaps you might invest the time you would have spent preparing further submissions on, oh, I don't know - your assigned work? We have a world to save, after all... or the rest of us do, anyway.
<br><br>Dr. Samina Ebadji

<br><br>The stimulus-driven switching of personae, however, is proving to be a greater software challenge than anticipated. Especially concerning are entrenched feedback loops between the disciplinarian and healer personae.
<br><br>I have also attached the reports from an incident where a servitor running the mother personae intervened on a disciplinarian servitor's behavior. A parental argument, if you will. Amusing on first glance, perhaps, but deeply concerning.

<br><br>The ectogenic chambers arrived two days ago.
<br><br>I've spent the last 36 hours examining them and poring over technical documentation.
<br><br>They're a revelation. Astonishing.
<br><br>I don't know what you had to give Far Zenith in trade to get these chambers - but it was worth it. In a single leap, their embryologists have vaulted past fifty years of technological shortcomings. The risks of ECMO - resolved. Nutrition delivery - resolved. Hormonal stability - resolved. Twelve other risk areas - resolved.
<br><br>Before I examined these chambers, I considered the Odyssey to be a fool's errand. But if the rest of FZ's technology is at this level, well... a human colony around Sirius doesn't seem so impossible after all.
<br><br>Mass fabrication of the chambers will present a number of challenges, but I'm confident they can be resolved. I'm going to rest for a few hours, then get back to it. Expect a fabrication plan within 48 hours.

        Just wrapped inspection of GAIA Prime site. Construction is well underway, reactor installed. Plans for control room remind me of starship bridges on those cheesy old SF vids. Living spaces for Alphas already completed - prefab modules. Fingers crossed we never have to seal ourselves in here... not that Elysium sounds much better.
<br><br>Spent last week at the Bryce site, designing ZD project labs, drawing up protocols. The base we're repurposing was huge - plenty of room for work spaces and residence blocks. The work crews already set up my office/lab. I'm not a fan of the glass wall. Guess Murray's intention was to ensconce me as "all-seeing presence." Ugh. Opposite effect. Makes me feel watched, on display. Tempted to paint it over.
<br><br>Herres recorded his presentation yesterday. Suitably bleak. Scheduled to record mine Friday.
<br><br>As soon as reception, lounge, holo theaters, and first residence block at ZD site are finished we'll start processing the candidates being held outside Tucson - 27 already. Extraction teams prioritizing Pac Rim &amp; Aussie candidates. How scared &amp; confused they must be, snatched off the street, carted across the world, held in cells. Here's hoping they understand once they see the big picture.
<br><br>Going to catch a few hours sleep here, then fly back to the ZD site. Herres promised delivery of qb lattices by noon. Expect Mk1 will take two weeks to machine, assemble, and test. I aim to launch GAIA at 0.6T grounding. From there I'll spin her up past 1.0T. Wonder how long it'll take to break the 1.38T record. MIE can go hang.
<br><br>Sleep.

        Last time I visited Prime was November of last year. Months since have been a blur. Flew out last night to oversee installation of the central armature and the master override (you're welcome, Ted) which was completed by 0430. So I decided to grab a few hours of sleep here before heading back to ZD. Called GAIA before I bedded down, ostensibly to update her on the site plan. But the truth is, I missed her. I've developed a habit of speaking to her before I sleep. Seems to be the only thing that calms me down these days.
<br><br>Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial's life chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?
<br><br>Forwarded the Odyssey message to the Alphas. Naoto replied in less than a minute - with a poem, of course. "The Building of the Ship" by Longfellow - and it's loooong, all right. I didn't read all of it, but it seems to be about launching a ship, rather than building one. This stanza (or couplet, or whatever) leapt out at me:
<br><br>Humanity, with all its fears,<br />
With all its hopes of future years,<br />
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
<br><br>Yeah, Odyssey and Zero Dawn both. Speaking of which, I should get back to ZD. Guess I should stop by Naoto's lab and check on DEMETER's progress, too. If I can get out of there without a volume of Tennyson pressed into my hands, I'll count myself lucky.
<br><br>'Til next time.

        Halloween.
<br><br>Travis came by trick-or-treating - dressed up like me. Should've seen that coming. I gave him a half-eaten packet of dandy wafers as a "treat" and kicked him out... but not before he invited me to some kind of "Italian horror extravaganza" he organized for ZD staff. Seriously. As though there isn't enough horror in the world already.
<br><br>Anyway, I was already scheduled to fly out here to G Prime for final inspections with Herres and the President's delegation. Ted was here, too, and he was not looking good. Kept fidgeting and couldn't seem to look me in the face without blinking. I was relived when he boarded his vert and flew back to "Thebes" (gag). Though I guess I shouldn't complain... if he wants to build himself a "deluxe shelter" to ride out the apocalypse, let him. Keeps him out of Elysium and away from me.
<br><br>Herres stuck around long enough to give me a detailed briefing on the strategic situation. Basically, we've entered the terminal phase. (As though the color of the sky when I was flying over here wasn't clue enough.) Another two or three weeks, and the atmosphere won't be breathable. The last vestiges of the European and West-African civ brigades are trapped with their backs against the Atlantic. The swarm that scuttled across Antarctica is crossing the straits of Magellan, about to start its death crawl up South America towards the Amazon. (All the work we did to reconstitute the rain forest... and it comes to this.) And advance elements of the Pacific swarms are already skirmishing with units on the Cal-Mar seawall.
<br><br>The noose is tightening. Projections show we can still finish in time, but the margin of error is +/- 10 days - not a good spread. If the plague breaks through ahead of schedule... Well, it just can't. I will not let that happen.
<br><br>Enough writing. I need to get back to Zero Dawn.

        Such a close thing.
<br><br>It's been, what, 43 hours since Herres warned me? Said collapse of the eastern line was imminent, swarms launching some kind of pincer maneuver vs. the Wichita salient.
<br><br>Five or six days more and I think GAIA could have launched without our help. I really do.
<br><br>We had to scramble. ZD became a madhouse. Absolute bedlam, every team rushing to stabilize code and lock it down as Gammas got evacuated, then Betas.
<br><br>Once GAIA was on her way, I gathered the Alphas together to give them the bad news. Felt like I was going to throw up. But they already knew, of course. They knew the work wasn't really finished. Close, but not quite there. Still tests to run, kinks to smooth- work to do. So they accepted it. No Elysium for us. We'll spend the rest of our lives here, testing and polishing each subordinate function to perfection.
<br><br>Guess that's what you get when you recruit a bunch of obsessive perfectionists. Managed not to cry until I got back to my office.
<br><br>So here we are, setting up GAIA Prime. And yeah, such a close thing. Makes me feel nauseated all over again when I contemplate how the fate of life could hinge on coincidence. If I'd never proposed the Lightkeeper protocol, there never would have been living spaces constructed here. If I'd abandoned the protocol sooner, the necessary life support systems never would have been installed. IF, IF, IF. At least we won't have to endure the creepiness of raising and training clones of ourselves. The genetic material was never processed out of the cradle sites, so it's not even possible. For which I'm glad. I really, really, wouldn't want to spend time around a young Travis Tate raised by Travis Tate. No, it'll be up to us to perfect GAIA, one generation only.
<br><br>Update: That was General Herres. The salient has collapsed. USRC expects to be overrun in two days, which gives us 72 hours at best to lock down and seal up.
<br><br>Buried alive--for life's sake.
<br><br>I'll go tell the others.

        FROM: Major Garrow<br />
TO: Gen. Aaron Herres<br />
SUBJECT: UltraWeave Progress
<br><br>General,
<br><br>You wanted fast, cheap and good, and that's what we're going to deliver. By using a flexible nano-fiber weave instead of plating, and enhancing protection with a 400 eV hard light micro-projector, we've reduced our testing cycle from weeks to days, and I'm confident we can get the suit out by next month, with enough production to cover dozens of elite units, at least. Better yet, it will be half the weight, half the cost, and offer twice the mobility. All we need is the balance of our funding, a few more techs, and another experienced test subject. I know resources are stretched to the breaking point, but any more delays will jeopardize the schedule, so please advise ASAP.
<br><br>May God be with you and Jane in these dark times.
<br><br>Semper Fi,<br />
Major Garrow

Pass Threshold: 85/100<br />
Results:<br />
Ballistic Test: 91<br />
Shrapnel Test: 87<br />
Laser Test: 88<br />
Shield Integrity: 86<br />
Impact/Torso: 51<br />
Impact/Arms: 62<br />
Impact/Legs: 43
<br><br>Notes: Weave is not tightening properly on local impact tests. We need to optimize existing sensors or add more.
<br><br>Trial 51-K: 10/5/65<br />
Pass Threshold: 85/100
<br><br>Results:<br />
Ballistic Test: 88<br />
Shrapnel Test: 91<br />
Laser Test: 87<br />
Shield Integrity: 87<br />
Impact/Torso: 67<br />
Impact/Arms: 75<br />
Impact/Legs: 81
<br><br>Notes: Sensor optimization successful, but torso protection still lagging. Recommend increasing weave density.
<br><br>Trial 53-R: 10/6/65<br />
Pass Threshold: 85/100
<br><br>Results:<br />
Ballistic Test: 92<br />

Laser Test: 86<br />
Shield Integrity: 89<br />
Impact/Torso: 84<br />
Impact/Arms: 81<br />
Impact/Legs: 13
<br><br>Notes: Getting there on the weave density and detection components, but an integration error on the left knee tanked the impact test. Ouch. Subject isn't going to be able to walk that one off. Surgery required.

        <b>Elisabet Sobeck:</b> Ok, GAIA. Sorry about that. Where was I?
<br><br><b>GAIA:</b> You were telling a story.
<br><br><b>Elisabet Sobeck:</b> Right. Yeah... so, like I was saying, it was a children's electronic kit, but I'd hacked the wiring to an auto battery and solar PV, so the grass caught fire. And so did a tall pine that'd stood there, I don't know, maybe a hundred years.
<br><br><b>GAIA:</b> Query: You were how old?
<br><br><b>Elisabet Sobeck:</b> Six. My mother was home, thank god, so she called the fire department and after, she took me out on the lawn and showed me the dead baby birds. Because there were nests in the pine tree.
<br><br><b>GAIA:</b> Query: What did you feel?
<br><br><b>Elisabet Sobeck:</b> I'm not sure. I remember yelling that I didn't care. And that's when my mother took my face in her hands and... spoke.
<br><br><b>GAIA:</b> Query: What did she say?
<br><br><b>Elisabet Sobeck:</b> She said I had to care. She said, "Elisabet, being smart will count for nothing if you don't make the world better. You have to use your smarts to count for something, to serve life, not death."
<br><br><b>GAIA:</b> You often tell stories of your mother. But you are childless.
<br><br><b>Elisabet Sobeck:</b> I never had time. I guess it was for the best.
<br><br><b>GAIA:</b> If you had had a child, Elisabet, what would you have wished for him or her?
<br><br><b>Elisabet Sobeck:</b> I guess... I would have wanted her to be... curious. And willful - unstoppable, even... but with enough compassion to... heal the world... just a little bit.
<br><br><b>Elisabet Sobeck:</b> Anyway, that's all I've got for now, GAIA. Time to tuck in.
<br><br><b>GAIA:</b> I wish you a pleasant sleep, Elisabet.
<br><br><b>Elisabet Sobeck:</b> Thank you. I'll catch you tomorrow.
