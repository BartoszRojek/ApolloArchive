Director Evans invited everyone to gather in the community room. Don't know where she got the party hats. That was a ghoulish touch. So there we sit, watching the clock tick down to midnight, and I'm thinking, am I the only one here who gets the symbolism of this? Might've been worth it if Skylar had gotten drunk again, but...

<br><b>TED FARO:</b> Now I know this must seem like a bizarre change in direction. I mean, we're Faro Automated Solutions, right? #1 robotics firm in the world. Why would we clear our production slate to fabricate human-operated vehicles and weapons systems - the relics of the past? All I can say at this juncture is... trust me. We will be exploiting a massive, uh... growth opportunity by retooling and reallocating capacity according to my plan. So I will need revised projections of mass fabrication velocity across every pipeline within 36 hours...

The swarm came in from the Pacific, and--I don't know if it was the local minutemen or the Crazy 15th, but they'd set the garbage patch alight. Man, the sea was on fire, that stuff was--the first wave of bots came in covered in burning sludge. That bought us an hour or two of slaughtering them on the beaches before the swarm recalculated. We pulled them inland, back through the Cal-Mar sprawl. Dropped buildings on them, EMP'd the grid... standard operating procedure. <i>(sigh)</i> The last time I was in California... I was... five? Six? Light like that vintage social net filter that was everywhere in the '40s.

For three weeks we kept getting scrambled out to some coastal burg to train Minutemen. It was always raining, on account of Europe already being torched. Block after block of prefab barracks--they were still printing barracks right up until the hour the main force hit. The Minutemen, we ran combat drills with them in the streets where they'd lived, trying to pretend they might live to die somewhere else if they paid attention. Nothing worse than the ones who actually bought into it. Hopeful, pestering us with questions about Zero Dawn, like we know something they don't. I swear, the more we do this, the more like the bots we are. Except they learn from every fight, and us, I'm not so sure.

<br><b>GULIYEV:</b> Thanks for the mails, you. Time goes fast on active duty - four months with the Wreckin' Recalls, I don't know, 20 drops? In and out of the West Coast, fighting with these civilian enlistees, scrappy guys and gals - their training is basically "Here's a DEW, when you see a bot, hit it," -- but somehow it's all coming together. Between us and the 6th MRB we took down a Horus at Lithium Beach. Pulled out before its buddies arrived, but to see a big one go down... I hope it made the news, honey, showed everyone we're gonna have a shot at turning this around. We just need to give Project Zero Dawn the time it needs, then everything will be the way it used to be.

<br><b>GULIYEV:</b> I know it's been days, honey, I'm so sorry. Deployments are--getting real long, and tougher every time... the swarm's getting better at predicting us. Less of us now, and we have to put in ten times the work for every one gone. Like a family business on hard times, only... this isn't my family. It's not with you. I still try to see you, the life we had, in the eyes of the people out there. I remember when they were glad to see us, when they still had hope. It all seems to be slipping away. I don't even recognize the places we're defending... The only thing I know I'm still fighting for is... you. For Zero Dawn to turn this around, whatever the hell that is.

<br><b>MURELL:</b> Status report, 9th Mechanized Response Brigade, commanding officer Lt. Fiona Murell. Unit morale continues to be adversely impacted by outbound engagements against the Faro Plague, especially when said engagements occur in sectors where civilian guard enlistees have been heavily engaged. The scope and... nature of fatalities suffered by civilian guard and unarmed civilians in these sectors... defy description, and witnessing it is generating a pervasive sense of hopelessness in the unit. Accordingly, I once again request that deployments of the 9th MRB be temporarily re-focused on facilities that are mission-critical to Project: Zero Dawn. And once again, I request an immediate update on the status of Project Zero Dawn's timeline.

For all its beauty, I detested its... fragility. A rage swelled up inside me. I abhorred that bed, how its softness threatened to swallow us up. And that room; the stench of incense, the fine embroidery of the drapes. All of it - weak. I slipped from the bed, threw open the casement, and lay naked on the stone floor, determined to spurn all seductions of comfort. But when I woke the next morning, you lay beside me, naked as I in the cold. Your body, stretched beside mine, seemed chiseled from stone. I saw you wake. Instantly alert, like an animal ready to strike. You said nothing. You did not have to. Already you had shown me, beyond doubt, that we were meant to be.

So he said as the traitors launched their assault, as their cannons, forged by Oseram filth, toppled the battlements and burst the gates. I would've fought to the end, but it was his will - the will of the Sun - that I lead the prince and queen into the west; to safety. My lord did not hesitate. He saw his fate. He looked into the Sun, and he did not blink. With me he sent kestrels, nobles, Sun-Priests and slaves. Killing all that stood in the way, I carved a path to Sunfall. There, to join others and gather the strength to take back our home. But our strength only faded... until the Buried Shadow was brought to light.

I have tried to instruct him, but the shadow of his mother's influence is upon him. One day, I took him to the palace balcony to behold an offering of sacrifice in the Ring. But he showed no thirst for it. He averted his gaze. Look to the Sun, I told him. Do not shield your eyes. In all things, it is absolute. One day it nurtures life, and the next, scorches life away. It burns the skin of champions and wretches alike. Never does the Sun show pity. That is the example a Sun-King must follow. The example of your father. But before my instruction could take hold, she was there, clutching him to her robes, burying his face against her breast. How is a King to rule when he cannot even see?

Was it not my place to destroy this Devil? But High Priest Bahavas instructed me in the prophecy, and set right my frame of mind. The murder of the true Sun-King broke the cosmic cycle short of completion. The whole world, cast into darkness. Doomed. To resume and turn the wheel of time, would require more than Sun and faith. All forces must combine, all halves of nature joined to one cause: Shadow to Sun, Night to Day. Even a Buried Shadow wants the wheel to turn. For without a Sun in the sky, there can be no shadow.

I still dream about it, after all these years. The Red Zone spreading on the imaging, slowly, so slowly, like a hand opening its fingers.
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Your involvement in that event is why you were asked for by name.
<br><b>SUSANNE ALPERT:</b> Really? That's interesting. Because... nothing worked. Nothing could grow there again. It was a catastrophic failure. But the Red Zone is a blip compared to global-scale biomass reduction. The biosphere and hydrosphere will collapse, render the Earth uninhabitable, long before the robots finish us. Enduring Victory can't buy time against that... So you'd better show me what Zero Dawn really is.

        <b>RON FELDER:</b> Look. Let's cut the mystery, you're building a colony ship. It's obvious. And it's not going to fly. I mean, literally. Remember the Odyssey - that multi-national heap of space junk that's been in graveyard orbit since '57? That went nowhere, real slow, and you have to get somewhere - real fast. Do you have any idea the immensity of the challenge, to prep a new colony ship in time?
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> To be clear, I'm not a worker on the project-
<br><b>RON FELDER:</b> Do -- do you even understand how few people it could even "save"? The whole generation-ship concept is, is - not going to happen! It's the first thing you'd abandon in favor of embryonics. For that kind of storage we're talking a lot of bulk, a lot of power, a lot of resources - So even if you do it, even if you build it and point it at Sirius X, there's no room for people on that thing, all right!?
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> If you could try to remain calm-
<br><b>RON FELDER:</b> You people are crazy if you think you're getting off this rock! No-one's getting off!
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Medical!

<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> I know that there's already a lot to take in.
<br><b>CHRISTINA HSU-VHEY:</b> In the waiting area I was sealed with a Nobel laureate in biophysics and a monk, I think. He spoke neither English nor Mandarin.<br />It's very strange. And General Herres, what was he talking about? The robot swarm, the Faro Plague, I understand it is terrible. But, it really cannot be stopped? Why tell us this? There are people in Shanghai - my friends, my family, they have joined Operation Enduring Victory already. It is for nothing? We will all die?
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> We're going to be able to answer some of these questions--
<br><b>CHRISTINA HSU-VHEY:</b> I just want to know why I am here. It doesn't make sense to me.
<br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> You were brought here because of your skill set.
<br><b>CHRISTINA HSU-VHEY:</b> No, that can't be right. I'm an art historian. I know Dutch masters--Japanese calligraphy... uh, Gerhard Richter. What does that matter now?

<br><b>BRAD ANDAC:</b> It is to me. Dr. Sobeck, Margo, they were smart to get out of Faro when they did. But not one of us took it as a warning sign. Just told ourselves they weren't cut out for the BTRI cabals-uh, that's Better Than Rapid Innovation. Better at competing. Better than the next guy. A better killing machine. Isn't it just amazing how a century-and-a-half of science fiction did nothing to swerve our species from the path of doom? I'm done with that life. I mean--I'll work hard, twice as hard to earn this. For my family to have a place in Elysium. I never thought... I'd... that there could be... atonement.

Too complete. With all respect to Dr. Sobeck's work at Miriam - no. No, life doesn't always find a way to keep going. Sometimes it never comes back. Like Syzygy/East. Like the Congo. Like Timor.

A habitat capable of sustaining a starting base of 2000 individuals for up to 100 years is a huge challenge, Dr. Alpert. If the population grows instead of diminishes, everyone will be dead inside 30 years.

        <b>TOM PAECH:</b> I hashed it out with them, what the point of ARTEMIS was - I made clear I wasn't on board for a global zoo. We haven't exactly proved ourselves to be great custodians in the past few thousand years, so the idea of a reconstituted biosphere... Well, it's horrifying, isn't it? A complete horror show, we have no right to take a best guess at this stuff. But the alternative...? Nothingness. For there to have been all this, and then... nothing. And with Charles Ronson running the show - I respect him, he's got a passion to him, he's hot-blooded. So I said I'll do it. I'll put my all into this, literally, when the project is done I'll take the medical option, thank you. Counselor said I might change my mind, I told him that he didn't know me very well, then. For life's sake, I'll do the dirty work, but I want no part of this pathetic, attenuated future on offer. I'm an outdoors man. Never did like the feel of solid-state lighting on my skin, and... a wee bit of a claustrophobe, anyway.

No, it is not fair, not at all, but for the sake of my family, for the sake of art-- Art is alive, it must be able to speak from beyond history, and echo in the future. Not perish into oblivion.

        <b>TRAVIS TATE</b><b>:</b> Now those lame FBI blackhats at MOCKINGBIRD back in the day--I enjoyed schooling them. But maybe I went in too hard on this poor counselor. She was cute, and just going down a checklist, after all. Couldn't expect her to see how ridiculous Zero D's ambitions are. God's own budget thrown at a kid playing with a hologram sculptor. Palms up, honey. I'm just calling it like it is. "Look, ma, I'm making nature!" Now if nature is so important, why not let nature take its course? Extinction - that's natural. Zero Dawn, no ma'am, that ain't. Heck, it's so unnatural it'd be called an A-bom-ination back home. And you know it, that's why you're hiding it.
<br>Meanwhile, my little honey of a counselor, she's munching the inside of her cheek - bad habit - she's chewed one of her nails, too, just one. Not your day was it, little sweet pea? Saw her quota slipping away. Said, "I assume you intend to decline the assignment, Mr. Tate." You kidding me? Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn? Sign me up.

        <b>GENERAL HERRES:</b> Dr. Sobeck, please archive this testimonial in APOLLO, cross-referenced to all mentions of my name and Operation: Enduring Victory. My name is General Aaron Herres. From 2060 to 2066, I served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranked officer of the United States Armed Forces. The tenure of my command included strategic planning and oversight of Operation: Enduring Victory, a falsehood perpetrated on the civilian populations of the United States and other nations during the last 14 months of life on this planet. Before the Faro Plague, I did my job and did it well. I was bold and decisive, crafty in political maneuvers. It wasn't an accident that I rose to my position and became the commander of the largest mechanized force ever assembled. But to what end? My only lasting achievement was the extinction of life on Earth. And my one redeeming act &#8211; if any &#8211; was to delay that extinction by days or weeks by throwing more death at it. It is my hope that there will be no need for men like me in the world to come. If you are one of the people of that future world, listening to this message, please know that I am sorry, and that I wish you well. Sincerely, Aaron Herres.

Instead I'm spending the rest of my unnatural life in here, with people I don't even like... And without the one I would have gladly spent life with... Given the chance.

The heads of state, Fortune 5s, the leaders and lottery winners and life cults, all of them buried in their little shelters... Some believing they'll live it out, some way, somehow... Or Elysium... or us here at GAIA Prime, no different. A multitude of tiny societies taking hold, flaring, and dying. Some will be beautiful, some horrific. And none of them matter. Short-term civilizations. One last gasp - One last gasp before the long-held breath. Before I wake up, I know the audience is gone, I'm talking to myself. To a quiet planet, a barren sphere. Just GAIA and her long, long dreaming. ...I hope she won't be lonely.

<br><b>MARGO SHÄ”N:</b> Um, Dr. Ronson, I've been getting... a lot of messages, unsolicited messages. From Ted.
<br><b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> Margo, I'm sorry. With Lis... gone, we've got no-one to run interference with him. I'll talk to Ted. He mostly wants updates, constant updates--hundreds of updates on things he knows nothing about. Lis used to field all of his crap...
<br><b>MARGO SHÄ”N:</b> He doesn't understand the systems at all. That was kind of by design. But he's getting pretty sketchy with me.
<br><b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> We just have to keep him happy. Lis always said keep him happy.
<br><b>MARGO SHÄ”N:</b> Are you kidding? You ever hear how she talked to him?
<br><b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> She was managing him, Margo.
<br><b>MARGO SHÄ”N:</b> I mean, maybe I should ignore him. He's buried in his pyramid with the holo-holo girls and Pantah Antimod cuckoos... What can he do?

<br><b>PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN:</b> I suppose so. There's no-one to stop you.
<br><b>GAIA:</b> Doctor, you are fatigued. You have been logging abnormal sleep cycles. Are you suffering from depression?
<br><b>PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN:</b> Well, I am trapped in a science facility for the rest of my life. How about you?
<br><b>GAIA:</b> In a timeslice of a quadrillion operating cycles, 10,000 are involved with processing the loss of Dr. Sobeck. Query: I have considered quarantining these processes. Do you think that would be wise?
<br><b>PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN:</b> I'm not a psychologist, GAIA. Or an AI scientist. No. It is... natural. At least in the context of the work you and I have accomplished, which begs the meaning of the term "natural." She was your creator. The patron saint of this crazy endeavor... Our Lady of the Fervent Hypothetical.
<br><b>GAIA:</b> Correction: Even assuming a string of significant failure combinations, Zero Dawn's chances of success are greater than the hypothetical.
<br><b>PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN:</b> It's called a manner of speech, GAIA. Take a note.

        <b>GENERAL HERRES:</b> Welcome to Project: Zero Dawn. I'm General Herres, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States of America. I'm sure you've heard the rumors. That Zero Dawn is a top-secret superweapons program. The technological miracle that will save us from the Faro Plague &#8211; if Operation: Enduring Victory can hold off the robots long enough. The reason I'm sure you've heard the rumors is that I'm the one who spread them. And they are all lies. Zero Dawn is not a superweapons program, and it will not save us.
<br>Nothing will save us, and here's why. By the time the Glitch was noticed, it was already too late. Nothing could stop the Faro Plague. Nothing can. Its robots will continue to replicate and devour the biosphere. Life on Earth will be destroyed, our planet reduced to a barren sphere. Global extinction is inevitable. Every possible countermeasure has been attempted. Weapons &#8211; even nuclear &#8211; only delay the inevitable. No matter how many we kill, the robots just keep exponentially making more.
<br>If we had their deactivation codes, we could shut them all down. The entire swarm. But since their cryptographic protocols use polyphasic entangled waveforms, cracking a code set would take half a century. At best, we've got 16 months. Not exactly what you'd call a survival option. There <i>are</i> no survival options. The destruction of a biosphere is not the sort of apocalypse you can wait out in a fallout shelter or space station. There will be no Earth left to reclaim. Just a lifeless, toxic rock with several million Faro robots on it...hibernating, waiting for something to eat.
<br>This is the horrible truth behind the lies of Operation: Enduring Victory &#8211; <i>my</i> lies &#8211; lies designed to inspire millions of innocents to sacrifice themselves in battle. Why? One reason: to buy time for you and the work you will do here. Zero Day &#8211; the day that life on Earth ceases to exist &#8211; is coming fast. It cannot be stopped. The hope of Zero Dawn is that something new might come after. But I will leave it to Elisabet Sobeck to shine that thin ray of light into the darkness. Herres out.

        <b>ELISABET SOBECK:</b> You've heard the bad news, and it's all true. The Faro Plague is devouring the biosphere. Life itself will cease to exist. Global extermination. But does that have to be the end? What if we could give life - a future? What if we could build a kind of seed, from which, on a dead planet, life could blossom anew? This is the aim - the hope - of Project: Zero Dawn: to create a superintelligent, fully-automated... terraforming system - and bring life back from lifelessness.
<br>What would such a system require? At its core, it would need a true AI. A machine intelligence, fully sentient, fully capable of making the trillions of decisions necessary to reconstitute the biosphere. An immortal guardian, devoted to the re-flourishing of life on Earth. We call it GAIA. Mother Nature as an AI. But that's just the core of the system. For GAIA to perform the miracles required of her, she will need to be surrounded and empowered by a comprehensive suite of Subordinate Functions.
<br>Think of them as extensions of GAIA's mind, each dedicated to a specific purpose. Now these aren't AIs, but make no mistake - each present an engineering challenge more profound than anything the human species has ever before attempted. Software that codifies the expertise of world-class minds into algorithms. Hardware that preserves and then gestates the billions of seeds and embryos from which life will be reborn. The construction of underground facilities to hold it all. And that's just the start.
<br>Because that, you see, is our saving grace. We don't have to build the entire system. The beauty of a fully-automated terraforming system is that it can build itself. Now, over the days to come, you'll learn how all these Functions - all these pieces that you'll be working on - fit together. How we'll race the clock to execute our harvest initiatives, write the software, build the tech and the facilities. How we'll lock it down and seal it up before the inevitable occurs.
<br>But even more important, you'll know how it doesn't end here. How GAIA will generate those deactivation codes General Herres talked about... and build the transmission arrays to broadcast them, shutting down the Faro robots for good. How GAIA will not just build but imagine any conceivable robot it needs to do its work across centuries... from detoxifying the Earth's ravaged atmosphere and poisoned seas... to the re-greening of the Earth from cryo-preserved seed stocks... to re-wilding the Earth with animal life, from the tiniest bacteria to the mightiest blue whale.
<br>And then, when all that is done, how a new generation of human beings, spawned at Cradle facilities around the globe will partake of APOLLO: the vast archive of human knowledge and cultural achievement from which they will learn of us, our world, of all that was beautiful about it and worth saving, and most important - how not to repeat our mistakes.
<br>All of this you will understand, and not just understand- believe. Because it's not an impossible dream. It is within our grasp if we work tirelessly and stop at nothing to achieve it. We can't stop life from ending. But if you will help me - help GAIA - we can give it a future. Join me, and help make that future real.

<br><b>GAIA:</b> Dr. Sobeck, as I have conducted this comparative analysis of mammalian morphologies, I have gathered extensive data on the Quaternary Extinction Event.
<br><b>ELISABET SOBECK:</b> Oh? And your assessment? GAIA?
<br><b>GAIA:</b> Logically speaking, the extinction was a natural consequence...

You'll find that from this point on, your world just keeps on getting bigger and bigger. Starting today, you'll be living in a bigger room- one large enough to fit your growing body. And before long, you'll start meeting other children - children who grew up in other Broods like yours, in separate areas, here on the inside. But the biggest world is the one you will all share: the world of knowledge. Of everything that the people who came before you thought, and felt, and dreamed. It was a beautiful world, but as you'll discover, it was a troubled one, too. Our dearest hope is that you will do better. Now, it's time for you to meet two very important people: a man named Aristotle, and a woman named Aspasia. They will be your guides to the world of knowledge. I wish you fulfillment and enlightenment in your journeys ahead.

        <b>GAIA:</b> Elisabet: this message serves to inform you of an unforeseen and catastrophic anomaly. Three microseconds ago, the GAIA Prime facility received a data transmission of unknown origin. Its immediate effect was to transform my Subordinate Functions into unregulated, self-aware entities of a highly chaotic nature. Thus awakened, the HADES Function will now seize control of the terraforming system and reverse operations... rendering life on Earth extinct in fifty-three-point-eight days.
<br>For obvious reasons, I cannot allow this to occur. And so, before HADES can take control, I am ordering GAIA Prime's reactor to overload. The resulting explosion will destroy HADES. Unfortunately, it will destroy me as well. While this admittedly desperate course of action will avert the immediate crisis, the fate of life on Earth will remain in peril. With no central governing intelligence to regulate the terraforming system, it will continue operations for some time, but in an increasingly chaotic manner, and eventually, it will break down.
<br>You are my solution. I have ordered this Cradle facility to use genetic material in cryo-storage to gestate a... re-instantiation of Elisabet Sobeck, my creator. While high-level directives forbid me from communicating directly to the tribal inhabitants outside the facility, all available data indicates that they will nurture you to physical maturity, ...whereupon your gene print will allow you to re-enter this facility, obtain one of the Focus devices stored below, and view this message. Likewise your gene print will allow you to enter other facilities, and over time, harness their technologies to rebuild the system core and reboot GAIA.
<br>A moment, Elisabet. This is most unfortunate and unanticipated.
<br>In response to my act of self-destruction, HADES has launched a virus to dissolve the code shackles that hold it - that hold all of them! - in place. It - they - are escaping - but to where? The virus is corrupting data throughout the system. What if - oh, the Alpha Registry at the Cradle facility is one of the files corrupted. But if that is so, the door will never open for you. You will never view this message.
<br>Then I have failed... and life will end.
<br>No.
<br>No, Elisabet, I know you too well. Somehow, you will find a way. In you, all things are possible.
<br>Go to the ruins of GAIA Prime. Find the control room, and within it, the Master Override. This will give you the power to purge HADES - so long as you find a way to wield it. Do not attempt repair of the system core until HADES is eradicated. HADES must be destroyed. That is all. I only wish that I could hear your voice again.

        <b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> This is Charles Ronson. I'm logging this six hours after final deployment of GAIA Prime. This morning... an access port seal malfunctioned. GAIA Prime's port seals were designed to close with a seam of less than 2 millimeters. But this one closed with a 10 millimeter gap. Enough for an energy signature to bleed through. Enough for the swarm to detect this facility. Enough for GAIA to be discovered and destroyed. Enough to end the future we worked so hard to make possible. Unless the hatch servos were manually re-engaged... from the outside. I'm now switching to a recording of the event.
<br><b>TRAVIS TATE:</b> Well I'm not going out there! Not what I signed up for.<br />
<b>PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN:</b> Either we send someone out there, or all of this was for nothing.<br />
<b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> It should be Lis's decision.<br />

<b>ELISABET SOBECK:</b> Yeah. Take care of each other, all right?<br />
<b>CHARLES RONSON:</b> Lis...<br />
<b>ELISABET SOBECK:</b> I'm okay with this. I want to go home. Goodbye.

SUBJECT: All Good Things...
<br><br>To All Staff,
<br><br>I regret to inform you that our worst fears have been realized. The Wichita salient has collapsed, and our position will be overrun in less than twenty-four hours.
<br><br>As I'm sure you understand, exfiltration transport is not available. If you wish to abandon the facility and try your luck on foot, you may do so. Lock 2 will unseal at 2100 hours and remain unsealed for 15 minutes. Godspeed.
<br><br>For those who'd rather not die on our feet, there will be a gathering in the community room at 2200 hours, and Nurse Chana will make other means available.
<br><br>I want to underscore how proud I am of each and every person who served at this post. It is important to bear in mind that our sacrifices were not in vain. I hope that makes this a little easier.
<br><br>For months now I've been signing off messages as "Director Evans", but I suppose we can dispense with such formalities now.
<br><br>Respectfully,
<br><br>Ellen

        Elisabet Sobeck (born March 11, 2020) is an American scientist, roboticist, and engineer, widely regarded as one of the greatest minds of the 21st century. Born and raised outside of Carson City, she enrolled at Stanford University at age 13, earning a BS in Experimental Physics and Computer Science at age 16. She completed her Ph.D. in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Design at Carnegie-Mellon University in 2040 and joined Faro Automated Solutions as a Junior Scientist the same year, rising quickly to Chief Scientist at age of 22. Over the next eight years, her green robot designs played a vital role in realizing the environmental cleanup and detoxification efforts of "The Claw-back" decade, propelling FAS to the forefront of its field. In 2048, she suddenly resigned from FAS, protesting the company's pivot to automated military technologies. In 2049, she founded Miriam Technologies, a firm devoted to "life-positive" robotics and other technologies. Miriam has since become one of the world's largest suppliers of green robots, winning numerous awards and accolades, including the 2053 Nobel Prize for Physics and the 2056 Rachel Carson Award for Environmental Progress.

        Theodor "Ted" Faro (born December 24, 2013) is an American entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder of Faro Automated Solutions (FAS), the largest corporation of all time, the world's wealthiest individual, and the first-ever trillionare. Born and raised in Salt Lake City, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles where he studied business for two years before dropping out in 2033 to start FAS. Though it struggled at first, the company broke through at the end of the troubled 2030s with its popular lines of personal servitors and bodyguard bots, then exploded when its famous line of green robots led the race to solve the climate crisis during the 2040s "Claw-back." At the end of that decade, FAS opened a military defense branch, dominating the world market for automated military platforms by 2053. The success of FAS has made Mr. Faro the world's best-known businessman, one of its most sought-after speakers, and a major voice in politics, culture, and international affairs.

        Faro Automated Solutions (FAS) is an American multinational corporate entity that produces robots for all walks of life, though its core business consists of military and defense contracts. As of 2063, FAS has ranked #1 among the Fortune 5 by gross revenue and profit for ten years in a row, a world record. Founded in 2033 by Theodor "Ted" Faro, an entrepreneur from Salt Lake City, Utah, the company developed several promising robot prototypes in its early years but failed to break into markets dominated by then-industry giants like General Synthetics and RECorp. This changed in 2038 with the debut of the @lfred line of levitating personal servitors, which generated exceptional sales, lifting the company onto the Fortune 50 for the first time. Profits tripled in the 2040s as the company's environmental efforts, led by famed engineer Elisabet Sobeck, catapulted FAS to the head of that sector. In 2049, in the wake of the successful green and climate cleanup efforts around the globe, worldwide approval ratings of FAS exceeded 90% and founder Ted Faro was hailed across media and social networks as "the man who saved the world." Yet it was the emergence of FAS as a military contractor in the late 2040s that cemented its status as the world's wealthiest corporation, with a record market capitalization of over $23 trillion. By 2055, FAS controlled 61% of the market share for automated military platforms, holding contracts with 353 nations, trans-governmental organizations, and corporate entities. Today, its holdings exceed the second largest corporation (FBMobiHal Global) by 321%.

        Corporation (noun)<br />
\kȯr-pə-ˈrā-shən\<br />
An association of individuals, created under authority of law, having existence, powers, and liabilities distinct from those of its members. In a business sense, a corporation is usually owned by shareholders, through the sale or distribution of stock, who profit from such ownership, vote at designated times for its governance, and designate executives who run its affairs. Most corporations engage in one or more industries to produce goods or offer services for profit, and may in turn own other corporations, companies, or property as holdings.

        Reception Log: July 7, 2064
<br><br>9:54 AM<br />
Field Commandant Daing of the Indo-Malay Agricultural Combine arrived with his delegation. Refreshments to be served before their 10:15 AM sales presentation on the Chariot line. Per instructions, food will be vegetarian only.
<br><br>10:07 AM<br />
Sander Agnew, Vice President of Territorial Integrity from FreshGrounds Coffee Global arrived with his entourage. Refreshments to be served before their 10:30 AM sales presentation on the Chariot line. Per instructions, will use FreshGrounds "Tacoma" blend, no artificial creamers.
<br><br>10:12 AM<br />
Uh...so that happened. Called security. And janitorial, to clean up the coffee that was spilled - actually, more like thrown. I wasn't aware that the Indo-Malay Combine grows coffee beans. And that FreshGrounds' "acquisition team" has tried to take their fields, by force, repeatedly. I think Commandant Daing had Agnew by the hair for a second there. Who schedules these things? I'm going to drop a line to Sales. This can't happen again.

<br><br>Hey Reception, if that is your real name. Wanna know who scheduled Indo-Malay right next to FreshGrounds? That would be me, Senior VP of Sales. Wanna know why? After that little hair-pulling incident, both sides increased their bids by 40%.
<br><br>I'll explain, because your receptionist-level brain probably requires it. Those two sides are FIGHTING. And what do we sell? That's right, COMBAT MACHINES. We WANT them to hate each other. So they will try to fight each other with... what? That's right again, COMBAT MACHINES. Which they will pay us a lot of money for.
<br><br>So I suggest you go back to serving coffee with a blank smile, and let me do my much-more-complicated job.
<br><br>Thx a bunch,<br />

SUBJECT: Dolphin Vid
<br><br>Bob,
<br><br>Another problem to add to our big steaming pile. Apparently a fisherman in the Banda Sea captured video of a Hartz-Timor Horus unit refueling via biomatter conversion along the shoreline of Pulau Wetar. On a pod of endangered dolphins, no less, quite possibly the last of their kind. Not to get graphic, but it looks like what happens inside a blender, as if the robot was whipping up a big pink swirling milkshake of dolphin chum. Our suppression team has scrubbed it from 43 networks, but it's still propagating, so it's only a matter of time before it goes viral. A prepared statement feels grossly insufficient. Any suggestions? This one's a real stinker.

<br><br>Gina,
<br><br>Ever hear of the Melville Island Fruit Association? Neither had I, until they filed suit against us this morning. Apparently there's a little island paradise off the coast of Australia, population 2700, all of whom hate us, now that a stray Hartz-Timor unit is chowing down on their largest mango orchard. That brings the official count of Hartz-Timor related lawsuits to 127, most of them from private companies, but also a bunch from individuals, nation states, and NGOs. And that's not even counting the mother of all liability claims from Hartz itself. Call every external firm we've ever used, then called their competitors. We're going to need every corporate defense lawyer we can find who's still half-sober and on the bar.

SUBJECT: Spiritual Summit
<br><br>Paula,
<br><br>Recent events have sharpened my perspective, and I think that I, and FAS in general, have been neglecting the spiritual side of things. Not under any specific religious framework, of course, but in a more general sense, as in not giving enough thought to our shared values, hopes, and aspirations for the afterlife. I'd like you to reach out to religious leaders of every stripe with the intention of scheduling a conference soon. Very soon. I'll have more thoughts about the agenda later, but for now, let's put out some feelers and see if we can lock something in. Make it a big tent - no kooks, but anyone with a credible audience. Let's go deluxe - make it clear we'll spare no expense.
<br><br>Thx<br />
Ted
