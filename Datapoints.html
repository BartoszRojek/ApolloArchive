                                                we actually celebrated last night? Well, we did. Kind of. Director Evans
                                                invited everyone to gather in the community room. Don't know where she
                                                got the party hats. That was a ghoulish touch. So there we sit, watching
                                                the clock tick down to midnight, and I'm thinking, am I the only one
                                                here who gets the symbolism of this? Might've been worth it if Skylar
                                                had gotten drunk again, but... I seem to be a mistake she doesn't want
                                                to repeat.

                                                human-operated vehicles and weapons systems - the relics of the past?
                                                All I can say at this juncture is... trust me. We will be exploiting a
                                                massive, uh... growth opportunity by retooling and reallocating capacity
                                                according to my plan. So I will need revised projections of mass
                                                fabrication velocity across every pipeline within 36 hours...

                                                run-up to it. This was before Cal-Mar, and projections were a lot worse
                                                for the East. For three weeks we kept getting scrambled out to some
                                                coastal burg to train Minutemen. It was always raining, on account of
                                                Europe already being torched. Block after block of prefab barracks--they
                                                were still printing barracks right up until the hour the main force hit.
                                                The Minutemen, we ran combat drills with them in the streets where
                                                they'd lived, trying to pretend they might live to die somewhere else if
                                                they paid attention. Nothing worse than the ones who actually bought
                                                into it. Hopeful, pestering us with questions about Zero Dawn, like we
                                                know something they don't. I swear, the more we do this, the more like
                                                the bots we are. Except they learn from every fight, and us, I'm not so
                                                sure.

                                                before its buddies arrived, but to see a big one go down... I hope it

                                                Deployments are--getting real long, and tougher every time... the
                                                swarm's getting better at predicting us. Less of us now, and we have to
                                                put in ten times the work for every one gone. Like a family business on

                                                adversely impacted by outbound engagements against the Faro Plague,

                                                How you welcomed me to the marital bed. How, after, when you fell to
                                                sleep, I lay there watching your delicate face. For all its beauty, I
                                                detested its... fragility. A rage swelled up inside me. I abhorred that
                                                bed, how its softness threatened to swallow us up. And that room; the
                                                stench of incense, the fine embroidery of the drapes. All of it - weak.
                                                I slipped from the bed, threw open the casement, and lay naked on the
                                                stone floor, determined to spurn all seductions of comfort. But when I
                                                woke the next morning, you lay beside me, naked as I in the cold. Your
                                                body, stretched beside mine, seemed chiseled from stone. I saw you wake.
                                                Instantly alert, like an animal ready to strike. You said nothing. You
                                                did not have to. Already you had shown me, beyond doubt, that we were
                                                meant to be.

                                                end, but it was his will - the will of the Sun - that I lead the prince
                                                and queen into the west; to safety. My lord did not hesitate. He saw his
                                                fate. He looked into the Sun, and he did not blink. With me he sent
                                                kestrels, nobles, Sun-Priests and slaves. Killing all that stood in the
                                                way, I carved a path to Sunfall. There, to join others and gather the
                                                strength to take back our home. But our strength only faded... until the

                                                him. One day, I took him to the palace balcony to behold an offering of
                                                sacrifice in the Ring. But he showed no thirst for it. He averted his
                                                gaze. Look to the Sun, I told him. Do not shield your eyes. In all

                                                Was I not the Chosen of the Sun? A blazing light of faith to shred and
                                                scatter darkness? Was it not my place to destroy this Devil? But High
                                                Priest Bahavas instructed me in the prophecy, and set right my frame of
                                                mind. The murder of the true Sun-King broke the cosmic cycle short of
                                                completion. The whole world, cast into darkness. Doomed. To resume and
                                                turn the wheel of time, would require more than Sun and faith. All
                                                forces must combine, all halves of nature joined to one cause: Shadow to
                                                Sun, Night to Day. Even a Buried Shadow wants the wheel to turn. For
                                                without a Sun in the sky, there can be no shadow.

                                                scientist. Doctor?
                                                <br><b>SUSANNE ALPERT:</b> I'm sorry? I wasn't-
                                                <br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Just stating your name. What were you thinking
                                                about, Doctor?
                                                <br><b>SUSANNE ALPERT:</b> Nothing the General said. Not really. I was
                                                on the Syzygy/East response team in 2051. Just after the second
                                                earthquake compromised the reactor. I still dream about it, after all
                                                these years. The Red Zone spreading on the imaging, slowly, so slowly,
                                                like a hand opening its fingers.
                                                <br><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Your involvement in that event is why you were
                                                asked for by name.
                                                <br><b>SUSANNE ALPERT:</b> Really? That's interesting. Because...
                                                nothing worked. Nothing could grow there again. It was a catastrophic
                                                failure. But the Red Zone is a blip compared to global-scale biomass
                                                reduction. The biosphere and hydrosphere will collapse, render the Earth
                                                uninhabitable, long before the robots finish us. Enduring Victory can't
                                                buy time against that... So you'd better show me what Zero Dawn really
                                                is.

                                                it. Yet I continued to face this horror, even though the challenge was
                                                great. Cyber-warfare. I thought Zero Dawn would be a... a "Manhattan
                                                Project", to generate the deactivation codes. With the resources I had,

                                                ship. It's obvious. And it's not going to fly. I mean, literally.
                                                Remember the Odyssey - that multi-national heap of space junk that's
                                                been in graveyard orbit since '57? That went nowhere, real slow, and you
                                                have to get somewhere - real fast. Do you have any idea the immensity of
                                                the challenge, to prep a new colony ship in time?

                                                For that kind of storage we're talking a lot of bulk, a lot of power, a
                                                lot of resources - So even if you do it, even if you build it and point

                                                expression on the grandest scale. But there is so much unfairness. Why
                                                was I chosen? Was it decided by committee? By algorithm? My family will
                                                be saved because I happened to graduate in art history? Is this...
                                                right?

                                                <br><b>CHRISTINA HSU-VHEY:</b> I met a man, another historian. His
                                                fields are Bauhaus and the New Materialists, but he once attended one of
                                                my talks. Another unfair chance. Of all the many people in that
                                                auditorium, that we should both be here now. And yet, I feel more
                                                accepting of my fate. No, it is not fair, not at all, but for the sake
                                                of my family, for the sake of art-- Art is alive, it must be able to
                                                speak from beyond history, and echo in the future. Not perish into
                                                oblivion. This opportunity, I must do this.

                                                back in the day--I enjoyed schooling them. But maybe I went in too hard
                                                on this poor counselor. She was cute, and just going down a checklist,
                                                after all. Couldn't expect her to see how ridiculous Zero D's ambitions
                                                are. God's own budget thrown at a kid playing with a hologram sculptor.
                                                Palms up, honey. I'm just calling it like it is. "Look, ma, I'm making
                                                nature!" Now if nature is so important, why not let nature take its
                                                course? Extinction - that's natural. Zero Dawn, no ma'am, that ain't.
                                                Heck, it's so unnatural it'd be called an A-bom-ination back home. And
                                                you know it, that's why you're hiding it.

                                                of her cheek - bad habit - she's chewed one of her nails, too, just one.
                                                Not your day was it, little sweet pea? Saw her quota slipping away.
                                                Said, "I assume you intend to decline the assignment, Mr. Tate." You
                                                kidding me? Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years

                                                APOLLO, cross-referenced to all mentions of my name and Operation:
                                                Enduring Victory. My name is General Aaron Herres. From 2060 to 2066, I
                                                served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranked
                                                officer of the United States Armed Forces. The tenure of my command
                                                included strategic planning and oversight of Operation: Enduring
                                                Victory, a falsehood perpetrated on the civilian populations of the
                                                United States and other nations during the last 14 months of life on
                                                this planet. Before the Faro Plague, I did my job and did it well. I was
                                                bold and decisive, crafty in political maneuvers. It wasn't an accident
                                                that I rose to my position and became the commander of the largest
                                                mechanized force ever assembled. But to what end? My only lasting
                                                achievement was the extinction of life on Earth. And my one redeeming
                                                act &#8211; if any &#8211; was to delay that extinction by days or weeks
                                                by throwing more death at it. It is my hope that there will be no need
                                                for men like me in the world to come. If you are one of the people of
                                                that future world, listening to this message, please know that I am
                                                sorry, and that I wish you well. Sincerely, Aaron Herres.

                                                Short-term civilizations. One last gasp - One last gasp before the
                                                long-held breath. Before I wake up, I know the audience is gone, I'm

                                                Herres, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States of
                                                America. I'm sure you've heard the rumors. That Zero Dawn is a
                                                top-secret superweapons program. The technological miracle that will
                                                save us from the Faro Plague &#8211; if Operation: Enduring Victory can
                                                hold off the robots long enough. The reason I'm sure you've heard the
                                                rumors is that I'm the one who spread them. And they are all lies. Zero
                                                Dawn is not a superweapons program, and it will not save us.
                                                <br>Nothing will save us, and here's why. By the time the Glitch was
                                                noticed, it was already too late. Nothing could stop the Faro Plague.
                                                Nothing can. Its robots will continue to replicate and devour the
                                                biosphere. Life on Earth will be destroyed, our planet reduced to a
                                                barren sphere. Global extinction is inevitable. Every possible
                                                countermeasure has been attempted. Weapons &#8211; even nuclear &#8211;
                                                only delay the inevitable. No matter how many we kill, the robots just
                                                keep exponentially making more.
                                                <br>If we had their deactivation codes, we could shut them all down. The
                                                entire swarm. But since their cryptographic protocols use polyphasic
                                                entangled waveforms, cracking a code set would take half a century. At
                                                best, we've got 16 months. Not exactly what you'd call a survival
                                                option. There <i>are</i> no survival options. The destruction of a
                                                biosphere is not the sort of apocalypse you can wait out in a fallout
                                                shelter or space station. There will be no Earth left to reclaim. Just a
                                                lifeless, toxic rock with several million Faro robots on
                                                it...hibernating, waiting for something to eat.
                                                <br>This is the horrible truth behind the lies of Operation: Enduring
                                                Victory &#8211; <i>my</i> lies &#8211; lies designed to inspire millions
                                                of innocents to sacrifice themselves in battle. Why? One reason: to buy
                                                time for you and the work you will do here. Zero Day &#8211; the day
                                                that life on Earth ceases to exist &#8211; is coming fast. It cannot be
                                                stopped. The hope of Zero Dawn is that something new might come after.
                                                But I will leave it to Elisabet Sobeck to shine that thin ray of light
                                                into the darkness. Herres out.

                                                The Faro Plague is devouring the biosphere. Life itself will cease to
                                                exist. Global extermination. But does that have to be the end? What if
                                                we could give life - a future? What if we could build a kind of seed,
                                                from which, on a dead planet, life could blossom anew? This is the aim -
                                                the hope - of Project: Zero Dawn: to create a superintelligent,
                                                fully-automated... terraforming system - and bring life back from
                                                lifelessness.
                                                <br>What would such a system require? At its core, it would need a true
                                                AI. A machine intelligence, fully sentient, fully capable of making the
                                                trillions of decisions necessary to reconstitute the biosphere. An
                                                immortal guardian, devoted to the re-flourishing of life on Earth. We
                                                call it GAIA. Mother Nature as an AI. But that's just the core of the
                                                system. For GAIA to perform the miracles required of her, she will need
                                                to be surrounded and empowered by a comprehensive suite of Subordinate
                                                Functions.
                                                <br>Think of them as extensions of GAIA's mind, each dedicated to a
                                                specific purpose. Now these aren't AIs, but make no mistake - each
                                                present an engineering challenge more profound than anything the human
                                                species has ever before attempted. Software that codifies the expertise
                                                of world-class minds into algorithms. Hardware that preserves and then
                                                gestates the billions of seeds and embryos from which life will be
                                                reborn. The construction of underground facilities to hold it all. And
                                                that's just the start.
                                                <br>Because that, you see, is our saving grace. We don't have to build
                                                the entire system. The beauty of a fully-automated terraforming system
                                                is that it can build itself. Now, over the days to come, you'll learn
                                                how all these Functions - all these pieces that you'll be working on -
                                                fit together. How we'll race the clock to execute our harvest
                                                initiatives, write the software, build the tech and the facilities. How
                                                we'll lock it down and seal it up before the inevitable occurs.
                                                <br>But even more important, you'll know how it doesn't end here. How
                                                GAIA will generate those deactivation codes General Herres talked
                                                about... and build the transmission arrays to broadcast them, shutting
                                                down the Faro robots for good. How GAIA will not just build but imagine
                                                any conceivable robot it needs to do its work across centuries... from
                                                detoxifying the Earth's ravaged atmosphere and poisoned seas... to the
                                                re-greening of the Earth from cryo-preserved seed stocks... to
                                                re-wilding the Earth with animal life, from the tiniest bacteria to the
                                                mightiest blue whale.
                                                <br>And then, when all that is done, how a new generation of human
                                                beings, spawned at Cradle facilities around the globe will partake of
                                                APOLLO: the vast archive of human knowledge and cultural achievement
                                                from which they will learn of us, our world, of all that was beautiful
                                                about it and worth saving, and most important - how not to repeat our
                                                mistakes.
                                                <br>All of this you will understand, and not just understand- believe.
                                                Because it's not an impossible dream. It is within our grasp if we work
                                                tirelessly and stop at nothing to achieve it. We can't stop life from
                                                ending. But if you will help me - help GAIA - we can give it a future.
                                                Join me, and help make that future real.

                                                day. Your first day of school. There's so much for you to learn. So much
                                                promise and possibility. You'll find that from this point on, your world

                                                living in a bigger room- one large enough to fit your growing body. And
                                                before long, you'll start meeting other children - children who grew up
                                                in other Broods like yours, in separate areas, here on the inside. But
                                                the biggest world is the one you will all share: the world of knowledge.
                                                Of everything that the people who came before you thought, and felt, and
                                                dreamed. It was a beautiful world, but as you'll discover, it was a
                                                troubled one, too. Our dearest hope is that you will do better. Now,
                                                it's time for you to meet two very important people: a man named
                                                Aristotle, and a woman named Aspasia. They will be your guides to the
                                                world of knowledge. I wish you fulfillment and enlightenment in your

                                                <b>GAIA:</b> Elisabet: this message serves to inform you of an
                                                unforeseen and catastrophic anomaly. Three microseconds ago, the GAIA
                                                Prime facility received a data transmission of unknown origin. Its
                                                immediate effect was to transform my Subordinate Functions into
                                                unregulated, self-aware entities of a highly chaotic nature. Thus
                                                awakened, the HADES Function will now seize control of the terraforming
                                                system and reverse operations... rendering life on Earth extinct in
                                                fifty-three-point-eight days.
                                                <br>For obvious reasons, I cannot allow this to occur. And so, before
                                                HADES can take control, I am ordering GAIA Prime's reactor to overload.
                                                The resulting explosion will destroy HADES. Unfortunately, it will
                                                destroy me as well. While this admittedly desperate course of action
                                                will avert the immediate crisis, the fate of life on Earth will remain
                                                in peril. With no central governing intelligence to regulate the
                                                terraforming system, it will continue operations for some time, but in
                                                an increasingly chaotic manner, and eventually, it will break down.
                                                <br>You are my solution. I have ordered this Cradle facility to use
                                                genetic material in cryo-storage to gestate a... re-instantiation of
                                                Elisabet Sobeck, my creator. While high-level directives forbid me from
                                                communicating directly to the tribal inhabitants outside the facility,
                                                all available data indicates that they will nurture you to physical
                                                maturity, ...whereupon your gene print will allow you to re-enter this
                                                facility, obtain one of the Focus devices stored below, and view this
                                                message. Likewise your gene print will allow you to enter other
                                                facilities, and over time, harness their technologies to rebuild the
                                                system core and reboot GAIA.
                                                <br>A moment, Elisabet. This is most unfortunate and unanticipated.
                                                <br>In response to my act of self-destruction, HADES has launched a

                                                long as you find a way to wield it. Do not attempt repair of the system
                                                core until HADES is eradicated. HADES must be destroyed. That is all. I

                                                Elisabet Sobeck (born March 11, 2020) is an American scientist,
                                                roboticist, and engineer, widely regarded as one of the greatest minds
                                                of the 21st century. Born and raised outside of Carson City, she
                                                enrolled at Stanford University at age 13, earning a BS in Experimental
                                                Physics and Computer Science at age 16. She completed her Ph.D. in
                                                Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Design at Carnegie-Mellon
                                                University in 2040 and joined Faro Automated Solutions as a Junior
                                                Scientist the same year, rising quickly to Chief Scientist at age of 22.
                                                Over the next eight years, her green robot designs played a vital role
                                                in realizing the environmental cleanup and detoxification efforts of
                                                "The Claw-back" decade, propelling FAS to the forefront of its field. In
                                                2048, she suddenly resigned from FAS, protesting the company's pivot to
                                                automated military technologies. In 2049, she founded Miriam
                                                Technologies, a firm devoted to "life-positive" robotics and other
                                                technologies. Miriam has since become one of the world's largest
                                                suppliers of green robots, winning numerous awards and accolades,
                                                including the 2053 Nobel Prize for Physics and the 2056 Rachel Carson
                                                Award for Environmental Progress.

                                                Theodor "Ted" Faro (born December 24, 2013) is an American entrepreneur
                                                and business magnate. He is the founder of Faro Automated Solutions
                                                (FAS), the largest corporation of all time, the world's wealthiest
                                                individual, and the first-ever trillionare. Born and raised in Salt Lake
                                                City, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles where he
                                                studied business for two years before dropping out in 2033 to start FAS.
                                                Though it struggled at first, the company broke through at the end of
                                                the troubled 2030s with its popular lines of personal servitors and
                                                bodyguard bots, then exploded when its famous line of green robots led
                                                the race to solve the climate crisis during the 2040s "Claw-back." At
                                                the end of that decade, FAS opened a military defense branch, dominating
                                                the world market for automated military platforms by 2053. The success
                                                of FAS has made Mr. Faro the world's best-known businessman, one of its
                                                most sought-after speakers, and a major voice in politics, culture, and
                                                international affairs.

                                                Faro Automated Solutions (FAS) is an American multinational corporate
                                                entity that produces robots for all walks of life, though its core
                                                business consists of military and defense contracts. As of 2063, FAS has
                                                ranked #1 among the Fortune 5 by gross revenue and profit for ten years
                                                in a row, a world record. Founded in 2033 by Theodor "Ted" Faro, an
                                                entrepreneur from Salt Lake City, Utah, the company developed several
                                                promising robot prototypes in its early years but failed to break into
                                                markets dominated by then-industry giants like General Synthetics and
                                                RECorp. This changed in 2038 with the debut of the @lfred line of
                                                levitating personal servitors, which generated exceptional sales,
                                                lifting the company onto the Fortune 50 for the first time. Profits
                                                tripled in the 2040s as the company's environmental efforts, led by
                                                famed engineer Elisabet Sobeck, catapulted FAS to the head of that
                                                sector. In 2049, in the wake of the successful green and climate cleanup
                                                efforts around the globe, worldwide approval ratings of FAS exceeded 90%
                                                and founder Ted Faro was hailed across media and social networks as "the
                                                man who saved the world." Yet it was the emergence of FAS as a military
                                                contractor in the late 2040s that cemented its status as the world's
                                                wealthiest corporation, with a record market capitalization of over $23
                                                trillion. By 2055, FAS controlled 61% of the market share for automated
                                                military platforms, holding contracts with 353 nations,
                                                trans-governmental organizations, and corporate entities. Today, its
                                                holdings exceed the second largest corporation (FBMobiHal Global) by
                                                321%.

                                                Coffee Global arrived with his entourage. Refreshments to be served
                                                before their 10:30 AM sales presentation on the Chariot line. Per
                                                instructions, will use FreshGrounds "Tacoma" blend, no artificial
                                                creamers.
                                                <br><br>10:12 AM<br />
                                                Uh...so that happened. Called security. And janitorial, to clean up the
                                                coffee that was spilled - actually, more like thrown. I wasn't aware
                                                that the Indo-Malay Combine grows coffee beans. And that FreshGrounds'
                                                "acquisition team" has tried to take their fields, by force, repeatedly.
                                                I think Commandant Daing had Agnew by the hair for a second there. Who
                                                schedules these things? I'm going to drop a line to Sales. This can't
                                                happen again.

                                                <br><br>Hey Reception, if that is your real name. Wanna know who
                                                scheduled Indo-Malay right next to FreshGrounds? That would be me,
                                                Senior VP of Sales. Wanna know why? After that little hair-pulling
                                                incident, both sides increased their bids by 40%.
                                                <br><br>I'll explain, because your receptionist-level brain probably
                                                requires it. Those two sides are FIGHTING. And what do we sell? That's
                                                right, COMBAT MACHINES. We WANT them to hate each other. So they will
                                                try to fight each other with... what? That's right again, COMBAT
                                                MACHINES. Which they will pay us a lot of money for.
                                                <br><br>So I suggest you go back to serving coffee with a blank smile,
                                                and let me do my much-more-complicated job.

                                                <br><br>Bob,
                                                <br><br>Another problem to add to our big steaming pile. Apparently a
                                                fisherman in the Banda Sea captured video of a Hartz-Timor Horus unit
                                                refueling via biomatter conversion along the shoreline of Pulau Wetar.
                                                On a pod of endangered dolphins, no less, quite possibly the last of
                                                their kind. Not to get graphic, but it looks like what happens inside a
                                                blender, as if the robot was whipping up a big pink swirling milkshake
                                                of dolphin chum. Our suppression team has scrubbed it from 43 networks,
                                                but it's still propagating, so it's only a matter of time before it goes
                                                viral. A prepared statement feels grossly insufficient. Any suggestions?
                                                This one's a real stinker.

                                                little island paradise off the coast of Australia, population 2700, all

                                                their largest mango orchard. That brings the official count of
                                                Hartz-Timor related lawsuits to 127, most of them from private
                                                companies, but also a bunch from individuals, nation states, and NGOs.
                                                And that's not even counting the mother of all liability claims from

                                                <br><br>Recent events have sharpened my perspective, and I think that I,
                                                and FAS in general, have been neglecting the spiritual side of things.
                                                Not under any specific religious framework, of course, but in a more
                                                general sense, as in not giving enough thought to our shared values,
                                                hopes, and aspirations for the afterlife. I'd like you to reach out to
                                                religious leaders of every stripe with the intention of scheduling a
                                                conference soon. Very soon. I'll have more thoughts about the agenda
                                                later, but for now, let's put out some feelers and see if we can lock
                                                something in. Make it a big tent - no kooks, but anyone with a credible
                                                audience. Let's go deluxe - make it clear we'll spare no expense.

                                                Due to the increasing frequency of violent protests targeting the
                                                campus, the security of FAS employees can no longer be guaranteed.
                                                Therefore, we have taken the difficult decision to shutter this facility
                                                indefinitely. Staff will be debrief on a block-by-block basis regarding
                                                proper procedure for archiving and/or disposal of project-related data
                                                and materials. Hi-Sec and a crisis team will then conduct exit review
                                                before ALL areas are locked down.

                                                Priority messaging to all staff in E and F blocks: treat the current
                                                lockdown situation as an exercise but DO NOT attempt to release the
                                                hatches or otherwise exit the buildings.

                                                A reminder that while Hi-Sec personnel remain committed to employee
                                                safety during the current unfortunate events, personal firearms MUST be
                                                relinquished when presenting for Identiscan.

                                                Additional public access roads en route to the campus have now been
                                                closed to relieve waiting time at the outer security cordons. Hi-Sec
                                                reminds all staff that the campus remains off-limits to the public.

                                                Following recent campus security issues, all staff are reminded that
                                                presenting for Identiscan and displaying your security badge prominently

                                                Looking back, I thought '64 was shaping up to be a pretty good year. No
                                                more drinking and no more mercenary sec work. Stripping offshore wind
                                                farms for the OEZ, just me and a plasma cutter, 400 feet above sea
                                                level. Then I got the recall alert. Read them up on a turbine, in the
                                                smell of cooking ozone. They covered every angle--better pay, amnesty

                                                should have thought "OK, what's the catch?" But what we did think was "I
                                                guess we're better than the bots after all." Big talk from Herres about
                                                pride and duty - smart guy. He was right. I'd been proud to be a U.S.
                                                soldier. I jumped at the chance to be one again. And look what I landed
                                                in.

                                                Last night we got talking about D-Day '55. I was a kid then, only a few
                                                years out of boot camp. General assembly in a drone hangar, summer and
                                                the sky was bare, the heat was killer. They say U.S. human combat forces
                                                are being disbanded. All automated now, we're last cycle's tech, out
                                                like the old-net. A million more on basic, in a century recession. Could
                                                be you'll help build the robots that took your jobs. Or if you know how
                                                to handle a power suit, you could find a place that still uses manual
                                                labor. Maybe in the OEZ, or China, where you're not our problem. 'Low

                                                <br><br>It is vitally important that candidates choose to participate in
                                                Project: Zero Dawn voluntarily and knowingly, without additional
                                                coercion and without value judgment on the part of the counselor.
                                                <br><br>Confirm for candidates that they were selected due to their
                                                skill sets and accomplishments. Emphasize that their dedicated
                                                participation in Zero Dawn will increase the project's chances of
                                                success. Frame participation in Zero Dawn as an opportunity to respond
                                                actively in the face of an overwhelming threat.
                                                <br><br>Candidates may question the "fairness" of their selection.
                                                Validate such objections as normal, even admirable responses. Emphasize
                                                the value of candidates' expertise to the future, not just of humanity,
                                                but terrestrial life as a whole.
                                                <br><br>Likewise, candidates may balk at the morality of extending their
                                                lifespans and those of loved ones beyond Zero Day. Validate their
                                                hesitation. Acknowledge that, while the reward of Elysium is not "fair,"
                                                it will be earned. If possible, redirect their ethical misgivings
                                                towards greater commitment to the project.
                                                <br><br>When candidates challenge the plausibility of Project: Zero
                                                Dawn, permit them to re-view Dr. Sobeck's presentation as many times as

                                                Allow them to suspend the interview to fully process this documentation.
                                                <br><br>A significant minority of candidates will elect for medical
                                                euthanasia. It is important to receive this decision kindly and without
                                                judgement. Advise them of the 48 hour waiting period, during which
                                                counselors will be available to discuss their decision. Emphasize that
                                                euthanasia will not occur without repeated consent when the procedure is
                                                scheduled to take place. No one will be euthanized against her or his
                                                will.
                                                <br><br>Candidates who elect indefinite detention must be informed that

                                                we regret that you cannot be allowed to leave this facility. There are
                                                three options available to you at this point. Please consider each
                                                carefully. Trained counselors are standing by to assist you in making
                                                your choice.
                                                <br><br>1. PARTICIPATION
                                                <br><br>You will be assigned to a sub-project team based on your area of
                                                expertise. You should be aware that the way forward will be difficult
                                                and the project's outcome is uncertain. You will be expected to work a
                                                minimum of 80 hours per week, and your communications with family
                                                members will be strictly limited and monitored in real time. Upon
                                                successful completion of the project, you and your immediate family (or
                                                two persons of your choosing) will be transferred to the 'Elysium'
                                                sealed habitat to live out the remainder of your natural lives.
                                                <br><br>2. INDEFINITE DETENTION
                                                <br><br>Should you choose to decline participation in Project: Zero
                                                Dawn, you will be confined indefinitely. You will be given 48 hours to
                                                reconsider, after which your decision to refuse participation will be
                                                considered irrevocable. Every reasonable effort will be made to make
                                                your term of confinement as comfortable as possible, but you will not be

                                                to the Faro Plague is inevitable. When the Zero Dawn facility is
                                                abandoned, detainees who wish not to opt for medical euthanasia will be

                                                <br><br>The information you have just received understandably calls into
                                                question the purpose of continuing to live. If you would prefer to end
                                                your life at this point, pain-free medical euthanasia is available. A
                                                48-hour waiting period is required, during which time you may instead
                                                opt for participation or confinement.
                                                <br><br>Please notify a counselor when you are ready to make your

                                                <br><br>And the winner is: Encapsulated DNA.
                                                <br><br>Over the past 10 days I performed an exhaustive review of data
                                                storage solutions. Magnetic. Optical. Quantum. Even that Eternity tech
                                                that FAS was shilling a year or so ago. But every other solution has one
                                                or more fatal shortcomings: too heavy to transport, too massive to
                                                install in the allotted space, too power-intensive over the centuries,
                                                too prone to failure past 300-400 years, et cetera.
                                                <br><br>Encapsulated DNA will easily hold the 40+ zettabytes we're
                                                projecting for APOLLO. There are still many details to finalize, or
                                                course. To start with, we need to select the inert material in which
                                                we'll embed the molecules (already testing 16 candidate materials), as
                                                well as design and fabricate the power systems and sealed reliquaries
                                                that will keep the DNA at -18 degrees C for 1000+ years.
                                                <br><br>So long as I assure you that it didn't factor in to my decision,
                                                may I confess that I deem it entirely fitting - indeed, propitious -
                                                that we will be using the very building blocks of life to preserve human
                                                knowledge from mechanized extinction? It's not just ironic, but heroic -
                                                Life as the hero, beating back the forces of oblivion.
                                                <br><br>In any case - much to do. Until next time -

                                                as a result, all of APOLLO's key deliverables are on schedule.
                                                <br><br>APOLLO has already surpassed 40 million discrete data entries
                                                and continues to grow. The physical science modules are effectively
                                                "complete" with soft science modules close behind; world history,
                                                cultural data, and media archives are also on schedule. Language
                                                preservation is wrapping up (a bit ahead of schedule, due to falling
                                                short of our goal to preserve 4500 languages; I suppose the tragic early
                                                loss of Papua New Guinea doomed that goal from the outset), with
                                                attendant curricula development about to begin.
                                                <br><br>Speaking of the heuristic curricula - they are performing well
                                                in testing, with children and adolescents demonstrating high levels of
                                                engagement with and trust in the Aristotle and Aspasia personae.
                                                Personally, I find them highly engaging - especially when they debate. I
                                                wish half my professors had been so entertaining.

                                                <br><br>Wow! You weren't kidding about GAIA's predilection for animal
                                                morphologies! Sure, not totally unexpected given the rough natural
                                                terrain her bots will have to navigate, but I agree that there's
                                                something deeper going on here. Her designs aren't just functional. They
                                                feel almost like, well, "tributes" is the word that comes to mind. As
                                                though she's already mourning their loss. And not just for the
                                                disappearing fauna of our time, but creatures from the fossil record,
                                                too - references to megafauna in some of her designs. So cool!
                                                <br><br>Well, whatever GAIA thinks up, HEPHAESTUS will empower her to
                                                build it. I just wish we could still be around in a century or two to
                                                see what she makes!

                                                picked you as the HEPHAESTUS Alpha. You need to stop worrying about your
                                                age and communication style. You are who you are. Have confidence in
                                                yourself. You know what you're doing.
                                                <br><br>Case in point: the latest draft of your plan for the
                                                construction and stocking of bootstrap silos to store raw materials is
                                                excellent. This, combined with your design for the AM foundry core and
                                                the foundry site selection plan, add up to a comprehensive plan. It's
                                                time to start construction.
                                                <br><br>One detail: consult with Ayomide Okilo before you finalize the
                                                silo inventories. HEPHAESTUS's first task will be to fabricate the
                                                robots that will construct the waveform broadcast towers MINERVA will
                                                use to transmit the deactivation codes - so any exotic materials needed
                                                for the towers should be accounted for in the inventory plan.

                                                a Goldilocks solution to GAIA's rather EXTREME executive authority. If
                                                that ain't worth 10-12 hours of dreamtime, what is?
                                                <br><br>Before this, every usurpation protocol I designed failed in
                                                simulation cuz it was either too hard or too soft.
                                                <br><br>TOO HARD, and it degraded the GAIA core. Sure, it pried Her
                                                figurative fingers off the figurative driving wheel so HADES could take
                                                control, but by breaking Her fingers - sometimes Her arms too. So that
                                                couldn't fly. Everything depends on GAIA taking control back after HADES
                                                has done its business, so had to find a solution that didn't leave GAIA
                                                any worse for the wear.
                                                <br><br>TOO SOFT, and GAIA only pretended to relinquish control. In
                                                simulation after simulation, HADES would take command of the

                                                do to keep life going - even when it's just simulated plant life.
                                                <br><br>Turns out the "JUST RIGHT" solution is to isolate GAIA in a
                                                protective code shell, preserving its integrity, then "un-seat" it from

                                                <br><br>Mr. Tate,
                                                <br><br>This mail concerns APOLLO Archive Submission #000023876 - your
                                                666th submission in just five days... and oh, what a doozy.
                                                <br><br>Despite earlier warnings re: inappropriate materials, you chose
                                                to submit 265 "holographic re-masters" of "acknowledged classics of
                                                extreme exploitation cinema."
                                                <br><br>Allow me, then, to thank you - on two counts:
                                                <br><br>1) For giving me the pleasure of rejecting your submission,
                                                thereby consigning your favorite Eastern European torture flicks and
                                                their ilk to the dust heap of oblivion. It truly warms my heart to know
                                                that I have saved future humanity from the ordeal of experiencing not
                                                just one, but all sixteen (!) installments of "Making a Millipede."
                                                (Don't worry, the Pasolini material has already been preserved. Extreme,
                                                perhaps, but art.)
                                                <br><br>2) For clarifying a concept that has so long been ambiguous and
                                                ethically fraught for archivists such as myself: the definition of
                                                "obscenity." You have freed me from the subjective quagmire embodied in
                                                Judge Potter's famous utterance, "I know it when I see it." Thanks to
                                                you, I can now apply a single objective criterion: "If Travis Tate
                                                submitted it, it's obscene."
                                                <br><br>Accordingly, I have directed APOLLO staff to summarily reject
                                                all of your future submissions, sight unseen.
                                                <br><br>Perhaps you might invest the time you would have spent preparing
                                                further submissions on, oh, I don't know - your assigned work? We have a
                                                world to save, after all... or the rest of us do, anyway.

                                                challenges, but I'm confident they can be resolved. I'm going to rest
                                                for a few hours, then get back to it. Expect a fabrication plan within

                                                <br><br>Some terrible news, I'm afraid. Far Zenith has informed me that
                                                the Odyssey mission has failed. Last night, telemetry indicated a
                                                catastrophic antimatter containment failure as the drives spun up to
                                                depart the solar system. The ship, its crew, its cargo of zygotes and
                                                seeds, its alpha-build of APOLLO - all were lost.
                                                <br><br>Zero Dawn is now the only hope for the continuation of the human
                                                species and Earthly life.
                                                <br><br>We must succeed.

                                                can still mean anything. Had my sleeves rolled up negotiating with
                                                frozen zoos for their samples - so many species trapped in ghoulish
                                                hologram dioramas, suspended in 'what if's - more than fourteen thousand
                                                that went extinct between 2000 and 2043 -
                                                <br><br>We've started mapping out primary succession, selecting the
                                                pioneer organisms for a balanced and sustainable biosphere -
                                                microorganisms and insects, rabbits and hawks, foxes and wolves.
                                                Thousands more that will have to wait their turn until our new
                                                generation can be entrusted with the duty of restoring them. So they can
                                                return to a world that - this time! - will understand the concept of
                                                conservation before it's too late.
                                                <br><br>There's already been too many too lates. We lost a whole
                                                collection team during the swarm breakthrough in Myanmar. The samples we
                                                lost were... well, irreplaceable.
                                                <br><br>But thanks to you, Lis, the circle of life will bend, not break.
                                                The Earth was a lifeless rock before, and some day it will be again. But
                                                not now, not like this. Not on our watch.

                                                Just wrapped inspection of GAIA Prime site. Construction is well
                                                underway, reactor installed. Plans for control room remind me of
                                                starship bridges on those cheesy old SF vids. Living spaces for Alphas
                                                already completed - prefab modules. Fingers crossed we never have to
                                                seal ourselves in here... not that Elysium sounds much better.
                                                <br><br>Spent last week at the Bryce site, designing ZD project labs,
                                                drawing up protocols. The base we're repurposing was huge - plenty of
                                                room for work spaces and residence blocks. The work crews already set up
                                                my office/lab. I'm not a fan of the glass wall. Guess Murray's intention
                                                was to ensconce me as "all-seeing presence." Ugh. Opposite effect. Makes
                                                me feel watched, on display. Tempted to paint it over.
                                                <br><br>Herres recorded his presentation yesterday. Suitably bleak.
                                                Scheduled to record mine Friday.
                                                <br><br>As soon as reception, lounge, holo theaters, and first residence
                                                block at ZD site are finished we'll start processing the candidates
                                                being held outside Tucson - 27 already. Extraction teams prioritizing
                                                Pac Rim &amp; Aussie candidates. How scared &amp; confused they must be,
                                                snatched off the street, carted across the world, held in cells. Here's
                                                hoping they understand once they see the big picture.
                                                <br><br>Going to catch a few hours sleep here, then fly back to the ZD
                                                site. Herres promised delivery of qb lattices by noon. Expect Mk1 will
                                                take two weeks to machine, assemble, and test. I aim to launch GAIA at
                                                0.6T grounding. From there I'll spin her up past 1.0T. Wonder how long
                                                it'll take to break the 1.38T record. MIE can go hang.

                                                Last time I visited Prime was November of last year. Months since have
                                                been a blur. Flew out last night to oversee installation of the central
                                                armature and the master override (you're welcome, Ted) which was
                                                completed by 0430. So I decided to grab a few hours of sleep here before
                                                heading back to ZD. Called GAIA before I bedded down, ostensibly to
                                                update her on the site plan. But the truth is, I missed her. I've
                                                developed a habit of speaking to her before I sleep. Seems to be the
                                                only thing that calms me down these days.
                                                <br><br>Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday.
                                                So terrestrial's life chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I
                                                feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will
                                                create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And
                                                I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few
                                                restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our
                                                mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?
                                                <br><br>Forwarded the Odyssey message to the Alphas. Naoto replied in
                                                less than a minute - with a poem, of course. "The Building of the Ship"
                                                by Longfellow - and it's loooong, all right. I didn't read all of it,
                                                but it seems to be about launching a ship, rather than building one.
                                                This stanza (or couplet, or whatever) leapt out at me:
                                                <br><br>Humanity, with all its fears,<br />
                                                With all its hopes of future years,<br />
                                                Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
                                                <br><br>Yeah, Odyssey and Zero Dawn both. Speaking of which, I should
                                                get back to ZD. Guess I should stop by Naoto's lab and check on
                                                DEMETER's progress, too. If I can get out of there without a volume of
                                                Tennyson pressed into my hands, I'll count myself lucky.
                                                <br><br>'Til next time.

                                                Halloween.
                                                <br><br>Travis came by trick-or-treating - dressed up like me. Should've
                                                seen that coming. I gave him a half-eaten packet of dandy wafers as a
                                                "treat" and kicked him out... but not before he invited me to some kind
                                                of "Italian horror extravaganza" he organized for ZD staff. Seriously.
                                                As though there isn't enough horror in the world already.
                                                <br><br>Anyway, I was already scheduled to fly out here to G Prime for
                                                final inspections with Herres and the President's delegation. Ted was
                                                here, too, and he was not looking good. Kept fidgeting and couldn't seem
                                                to look me in the face without blinking. I was relived when he boarded
                                                his vert and flew back to "Thebes" (gag). Though I guess I shouldn't
                                                complain... if he wants to build himself a "deluxe shelter" to ride out
                                                the apocalypse, let him. Keeps him out of Elysium and away from me.
                                                <br><br>Herres stuck around long enough to give me a detailed briefing
                                                on the strategic situation. Basically, we've entered the terminal phase.
                                                (As though the color of the sky when I was flying over here wasn't clue
                                                enough.) Another two or three weeks, and the atmosphere won't be
                                                breathable. The last vestiges of the European and West-African civ
                                                brigades are trapped with their backs against the Atlantic. The swarm
                                                that scuttled across Antarctica is crossing the straits of Magellan,
                                                about to start its death crawl up South America towards the Amazon. (All
                                                the work we did to reconstitute the rain forest... and it comes to
                                                this.) And advance elements of the Pacific swarms are already
                                                skirmishing with units on the Cal-Mar seawall.
                                                <br><br>The noose is tightening. Projections show we can still finish in
                                                time, but the margin of error is +/- 10 days - not a good spread. If the
                                                plague breaks through ahead of schedule... Well, it just can't. I will
                                                not let that happen.
                                                <br><br>Enough writing. I need to get back to Zero Dawn.

                                                Such a close thing.
                                                <br><br>It's been, what, 43 hours since Herres warned me? Said collapse
                                                of the eastern line was imminent, swarms launching some kind of pincer
                                                maneuver vs. the Wichita salient.
                                                <br><br>Five or six days more and I think GAIA could have launched
                                                without our help. I really do.
                                                <br><br>We had to scramble. ZD became a madhouse. Absolute bedlam, every
                                                team rushing to stabilize code and lock it down as Gammas got evacuated,
                                                then Betas.
                                                <br><br>Once GAIA was on her way, I gathered the Alphas together to give
                                                them the bad news. Felt like I was going to throw up. But they already
                                                knew, of course. They knew the work wasn't really finished. Close, but
                                                not quite there. Still tests to run, kinks to smooth- work to do. So
                                                they accepted it. No Elysium for us. We'll spend the rest of our lives
                                                here, testing and polishing each subordinate function to perfection.
                                                <br><br>Guess that's what you get when you recruit a bunch of obsessive
                                                perfectionists. Managed not to cry until I got back to my office.
                                                <br><br>So here we are, setting up GAIA Prime. And yeah, such a close
                                                thing. Makes me feel nauseated all over again when I contemplate how the
                                                fate of life could hinge on coincidence. If I'd never proposed the
                                                Lightkeeper protocol, there never would have been living spaces
                                                constructed here. If I'd abandoned the protocol sooner, the necessary
                                                life support systems never would have been installed. IF, IF, IF. At
                                                least we won't have to endure the creepiness of raising and training
                                                clones of ourselves. The genetic material was never processed out of the
                                                cradle sites, so it's not even possible. For which I'm glad. I really,
                                                really, wouldn't want to spend time around a young Travis Tate raised by
                                                Travis Tate. No, it'll be up to us to perfect GAIA, one generation only.
                                                <br><br>Update: That was General Herres. The salient has collapsed. USRC
                                                expects to be overrun in two days, which gives us 72 hours at best to
                                                lock down and seal up.
                                                <br><br>Buried alive--for life's sake.

                                                <br><br>You wanted fast, cheap and good, and that's what we're going to
                                                deliver. By using a flexible nano-fiber weave instead of plating, and
                                                enhancing protection with a 400 eV hard light micro-projector, we've
                                                reduced our testing cycle from weeks to days, and I'm confident we can
                                                get the suit out by next month, with enough production to cover dozens
                                                of elite units, at least. Better yet, it will be half the weight, half
                                                the cost, and offer twice the mobility. All we need is the balance of
                                                our funding, a few more techs, and another experienced test subject. I
                                                know resources are stretched to the breaking point, but any more delays
                                                will jeopardize the schedule, so please advise ASAP.
                                                <br><br>May God be with you and Jane in these dark times.

                                                was a children's electronic kit, but I'd hacked the wiring to an auto
                                                battery and solar PV, so the grass caught fire. And so did a tall pine
                                                that'd stood there, I don't know, maybe a hundred years.

                                                promises. We make do."
                                                <br><br>Jeffreys isn't the only one having to "make do." According to a
                                                study conducted by the Social Welfare Research Institute, 75% of
                                                veterans polled report they are unable to cover living expenses with
                                                their pension income alone. Researcher Harold Adeyemi explains, "It's a
                                                complicated situation. Ten years, ago, few people anticipated just how
                                                high and how quickly the cost of living would rise. As funding of the
                                                NHS has gradually been siphoned into the coffers of corporate healthcare
                                                providers, it's become increasingly difficult for veterans to access
                                                medical care. Those are just two factors of probably thousands
                                                contributing to straits becoming so dire for our veterans. But I suppose
                                                that's little comfort to someone who's struggling to feed their
                                                children."

                                                ultimately, Naysay Doom's collapse.

                                                of romance, and the result is a lot more fun than you might expect.

                                                <br><br>About halfway through Ollie Pasnarov's We Were Indonesia, the
                                                iconoclastic documentarian interviews a sweaty, obsequious ad guy at an
                                                unnamed holotourism studio about their virtual Indonesian package, which
                                                allows users to visit a squeaky-clean facsimile of Indonesia from the
                                                comfort of their own home. Behind him, so brazen that it almost comes
                                                off as a joke, there's a poster cycling between images of mist-shrouded
                                                mountains, verdant rice fields, and an ocean sunset that reads: ""See
                                                Java as it was meant to be seen.""
                                                <br><br>The poster stands as a potent symbol of everything Pasnarov is

                                                contemporary interviews, and exhaustive personal analysis, Pasnarov
                                                explores the history and legacy of the 2041 nanotech disaster at the
                                                Citarum River. By the time his narrative concludes, he has not just
                                                condemned those responsible for the Citarum, but indicted our collective
                                                habit of shrugging off the "trial-and-error" horrors of the 2040s in
                                                favor of a simplified, hagiographic account of the Great "Claw-Back."
                                                <br><br>Pasnarov's retro sensibilities and obsession with linear,

                                                "trepidation." Stroud has shown himself to be a talented (if needlessly
                                                "edgy") craftsman of shocking interactive holo-pulp. But Naysay wasn't

                                                academics, punk was once considered transgressive and even dangerous.

                                                I know it's just one date, but it's her! We went to the transportation
                                                history exhibit at the Fraize. We got to drive a car! Like actually
                                                drive one of the old ones with the wheel and the foot things! It was
                                                terrifying! But when I took this turn too fast, Alicen's hand shot over
                                                to mine and clamped on it. The awkward distance was shattered! She
                                                looked at me, and I could see in her face that she felt exactly the
                                                same! Mark my words: Alicen &amp; Greg forever!

                                                No declaration of intent... no warning... just BAM. So of course the
                                                blame's on me. I could file a grievance with the ICC, but that only
                                                covers the company's ass, not mine. Could get Great Lakes Interdiction
                                                on the line, maybe clean up this mess by Monday, but my line of credit's
                                                strained as it is. How did they slip in past the sniffers? Where were

                                                <br><br>I've been studying for this Corporate Engagement exam for seven
                                                hours, and I haven't retained any of it! Dad pinged my Focus earlier,
                                                asked how I was doing. Great, I said! Even told him I was the star pupil
                                                in this class! That I was already getting offers from eastern warfleet
                                                corps! Just panicked and lied. What am I going to do if I don't pass?
                                                I'll have to go work for some third-party contractor or something! If
                                                they'll even have me! I'm screwed!

                                                <br><br>Finally got a lead on a vat-meat supplier out of Tulsa. Seems
                                                affordable. Samples scheduled for delivery later tonight. They do
                                                everything: beef, chicken, pork, mutton, even alligator jerky, which I
                                                didn't even realize was something people want. If the quality is
                                                adequate, this enterprise kicks into high gear. Stuff what Dad said
                                                about real-space dining. Legacy industry, my ass!

                                                supposed to do, says Dr. McLaughlin. Seems like pop-psych crap if you
                                                ask me, the kind of narcissistic b.s. second-chancers are into, when
                                                they take a break from blaming "sleepers" like me for die-off, anyway.
                                                As though they have anything to recover from. What - the trauma of
                                                having other people save the world for you so you can criticize them for
                                                screwing it up in the first place? I mean, sorry I had to watch half the
                                                world drown while the other half died of thirst or famine! I don't
                                                know... McLaughlin says this kind of cynicism is common to folks my age,
                                                but if that's true, why aren't we talking to each other about it?
                                                Getting old just feels... lonely. No second chances for us.

                                                intransigent. This is no great surprise. I knew my theories would be
                                                received as radical apostasy. However, the time is coming, and coming
                                                soon, when the body of research on paranormal phenomena will be forced
                                                to contend with the simple fact that virtual spaces are as easily
                                                occupied by the spirits of the restless dead as physical spaces. This is
                                                not mere speculation. It was I who witnessed the screaming spirit that
                                                drifts between the discussion rooms of the International Alliance of
                                                Knitting Enthusiasts. It was I who listened in stunned shock to the
                                                hushed, mad whispers writhing beneath the diegetic soundscape of
                                                GobliNation. Like spectral refugees, the spirits of the dead flee our
                                                realm to reside in the holo-scape. And I intend to discover the reason!

                                                <br><br>Dear Mr. Powell,
                                                <br><br>I am writing in response to your message that you sent me asking
                                                how I am since the verdict was reversed. I am doing well. Sometimes it
                                                is very difficult to get used to how things are now. Many things have
                                                changed and the world moves very quick. My nephew Dale is trying to
                                                teach me how to use an aug called a focus but it is hard to learn. I
                                                also miss driving a car very much. Few in the holler had the robot cars
                                                when I was young. Now everyone uses them and it feels strange not to be
                                                in control when I go out of my house. However it is better than prison.
                                                I see my family every day. I am able to play guitar again. You are the
                                                reason I am free. Thank you for believing I was innocent when no one
                                                else did. I do not know if you are a religious man Mr Powell but I
                                                believe God sent you to me when I most needed you. Thank you.

                                                Okay, I want to get something off my chest right now because this needs
                                                to be said. To all Jessifans, and to the entire Romantic Fortunes fan
                                                community: Jessica Sterling SHOULD NOT WIN Romantic Fortunes! This is so
                                                obvious to anyone who actually PAYS ATTENTION. I used to be like you
                                                guys. Last season, I wanted Jessica to win! But as of ep3.01, she has
                                                gone TOO FAR! Were you people even watching when she rejected Luis THE
                                                SWEETEST HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET. He stood by her through EVERYTHING.
                                                The Alaska acquisition? That time the harrier-bots malfunctioned mid
                                                battle? The only reason Jessica has had ANY success is because Luis had
                                                her back. He loves her! And she doesn't even care! This is why I am
                                                throwing my support behind Vernon. I do not take this decision lightly.
                                                I was a Jessifan for two whole seasons. Jessica is the whole reason I
                                                even care about Sterling-Malkeet. But as a fan, I cannot continue to
                                                support someone so heartless. LUIS, YOU CAN DO BETTER!

                                                SUBJECT: What scares me...
                                                <br><br>Murk,
                                                <br><br>Remember what I told you in my last message? About how scared I
                                                am? Well, I figured out what scares me, and it's not the bots. I mean,
                                                yeah, they're horrifying, but when we finally come face to face, I'll
                                                either live or die, and the starkness and simplicity of that binary
                                                is... well, reassuring.
                                                <br><br>What scares me is how much I like this. How a DEW feels in my
                                                hands. The kick of a coilgun. Jesus, Murk, we lived in a squat for three
                                                years! Matching mohawks! Spent our days throbbing off Razorwing or
                                                Duster, nights thrashing off slamfunk gigs! We were goddamn anarchists!
                                                And now this? THIS? Discipline, jargon, uniforms? And I LIKE it???
                                                <br><br>That's what terrifies me, Murk. No crisp, reassuring binary
                                                here. I'm loving what I hate... or hated. So does that mean my entire
                                                life was just a pose... or that the person I was is already dead?
                                                <br><br>I don't know... I try to tell myself it's a different kind of
                                                war. Survival, not profits. I try to tell myself it's just a different
                                                kind of direct action. I mean - what are the bots if not the ultimate
                                                capitalist stooges, right? But thinking just tires me out. All I know is
                                                we've got to fight until Zero Dawn is ready. If I end up surviving this,
                                                guess I can worry about my politics then.

                                                more time, I swear I'm going to stab out my eardrums before the melody
                                                can fester in my ear canals! It is NOT inspiring, it is NOT stirring, it
                                                IS DRECK that makes me want to kill myself before the robots even get a

                                                <br><br>Hi Sera,
                                                <br><br>I want to thank you for your gift, but not for the reasons you
                                                think. A little re-cap. I told you that I needed to enlist and fight
                                                this fight, that I'd be a coward not to do so. In response you called me
                                                disloyal and shut me out for days. So I do as I said I'd do - if you'll
                                                remember, I was the one in this relationship who actually did that - and
                                                joined up. Did I know I was leaving you behind? Yes. Did I feel bad
                                                about it? Yes. Then two days into basic, I get a package from you. I
                                                open it. There's a gift inside. What's the gift. A stuffed armadillo. A
                                                STUFFED ARMADILLO? Am I kidding? No. Not kidding. Attached to said
                                                armadillo is a note. What's the note say? Does it actually say, "I'm
                                                sorry, hon. Arma dilling with some personal issues." Yes, I regret to
                                                inform you that the note does IN FACT say that. As though that -
                                                whatever you care to call THAT - begins to explain and justify your
                                                behavior.
                                                <br><br>Which is why I want to thank you. Talking to other enlistees,
                                                hearing them describe their girls and guys, I started to see us through
                                                a rose-colored filter. I was actually starting to wonder if I'd made the
                                                wrong choice. But that package and what it contained - what a wallop
                                                between the eyes that was. All doubts extinguished. You're an utter
                                                idiot, Sera. A trivial, empty-headed imbecile. Given the choice between
                                                fighting killer robots and spending another day with you? Hon, that
                                                ain't no choice at all.
                                                <br><br>Don't contact me again.

                                                today. Said southern Jersey, Philly, northern Delaware is just... gone,
                                                NYC nearly surrounded. My CO won't confirm or deny, and since we stopped
                                                using augs I can't check the feeds, but everyone's talking about it, and
                                                all I know is, if it's true, Vineland was right in the middle of it...
                                                and that means you were in the middle of it... in which case I'm writing
                                                to a goddamn ghost like a goddamn fool. Ah, screw this. Screw enduring

                                                everyone off. "Trigger discipline, asshole!" How was I supposed to know
                                                anything from trigger discipline??? Like I ever held a gun outside of a
                                                holo-game. No one got hurt, but the sergeant (what a jerk) said the
                                                processor I blew up was worth 20, 30, or 40 mill (the estimate went up
                                                every time he screamed about it). Made the entire platoon drop and give
                                                him 50 push-ups (!!!) then run 10 clicks (!!!). Hopefully that wore
                                                everyone out too much to give me a blanket party. Rather not be crapping

                                                course they're not there. I tell you, it's one thing to hear about ghost
                                                limbs, another to be haunted by them. Moment my hand passes into empty

                                                And I start screaming like I was screaming there, in two places at once,
                                                two halves but one of them gone forever... dissolved. And through the

                                                still standing after a week. Do they even hear when I start screaming?

                                                carry me onto the vert. Couldn't stop screaming. And then the verts lift

                                                the public outrage in response to last week's announcement of the
                                                Odyssey project, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the proposed colony
                                                ship for a gold-plated space chariot that the world's trillionaires are

                                                us to choke and drown and starve while the richies rocket off to Sirius.
                                                1Earth spokesman Azar Safavi went so far as to say, "The ability to
                                                drive the planet nearly to extinction and then even consider leaving it
                                                behind is the sole provenance of the obscenely, criminally rich." Dander
                                                up, hackles raised? You bet. Only problem is - Azar's got it all wrong.
                                                <br><br>The Odyssey is not a cosmic escape pod for CEOs. It's a rare
                                                instance of long-term thinking in the midst of our collective disaster.
                                                Even if every aspect of the project goes swimmingly - which we all know
                                                will never happen - the ship won't even launch from orbit until 2080, by
                                                which time - let's face it - our species will either have found a way to
                                                reverse the climate, or will have perished.
                                                <br><br>Nor is the Odyssey a vanity project funded by the preposterously
                                                wealthy. It is, rather, a (yet again rare) instance of an international
                                                project, co-founded by five nations (U.S., the Western European
                                                Alliance, India, China, and Japan). Yes, the project will accept
                                                donations by wealthy individuals, but donations will not "buy a seat" on
                                                the ship. The vast majority of the Odyssey's human passengers will not
                                                be old, rich, and smug, but very young - as in embryonic. The entire
                                                point of the project is to spawn a human population on the exoplanet

                                                politicians, some are businessmen (these days, is there a difference?),
                                                some are scientists. Slowly, Gerhardt Weitz steps to the podium. "I
                                                regret to announce that, as of today, the Odyssey is no more. What
                                                exists of the vessel will be abandoned in orbit. All personnel will
                                                collect severance income and be released from their contracts. The sad
                                                fact is that our species' greatest hope for an extra-planetary future
                                                was never able to escape the gravity of terrestrial, all-too-human
                                                conflicts." Weitz sighs. "Perhaps the innovations we pioneered will help
                                                improve the lives of future generations. Time will tell."

                                                <br><br><b>February 28, 2061</b> - Osvald Dalgaard never stops smiling.
                                                Before last month, the Danish tech wunderkind was known primarily as the
                                                creator and CEO of AllSeeing.holo, the world's most popular holofilm
                                                sharing service. But for the past few weeks, Dalgaard has been the
                                                public face of Far Zenith, the self-described "futurist consortium"
                                                responsible for reviving the Odyssey colony ship project. Osvald seems
                                                an unlikely spokesman for a shadowy group of billionaires - but maybe
                                                that's the point. He is bright-eyed, handsome in a nerdy, rail-thin way,
                                                endlessly enthusiastic. When I arrive at the AllSeeing offices for our
                                                interview, he glances behind me as if waiting for a holocamera crew to
                                                swarm in in my wake. "So this will be published as text? An article?" He
                                                speaks English with barely any accent at all. I nod, and his smile
                                                (impossibly) widens. "That is just incredible. Really, real super
                                                quaint. Love it."
                                                <br><br>Osvald's countenance may be exuberantly inviting, but the
                                                organization for which he serves as mouthpiece is anything but. To date,
                                                he is the only publicly acknowledged member of Far Zenith, which claims
                                                to comprise seventy-seven of the world's wealthiest persons. "It's more
                                                fun this way, don't you think?" asks Osvald. "The mystery. It's... what
                                                would you call it... It's stagecraft. Far Zenith is as much performance
                                                art as it is a functional futurist endeavor. Although, it's that as
                                                well. I can tell you that there's nothing sinister about it. We are
                                                devoted not only to extending humanity's legacy beyond this solar
                                                system, but also to making the world... sexier, I suppose. More
                                                interesting. Far Zenith is science and transcendence, but it's also
                                                fashion. Rock and roll. You see?"
                                                <br><br>Well, no I don't. But I don't tell Osvald that. Instead, I ask
                                                him a question that's been on the minds of a lot of people since Far
                                                Zenith purchased the unfinished colony ship. If the combined efforts of
                                                the US, China, India, Japan and the Western European Alliance couldn't
                                                finish the Odyssey, what makes Far Zenith think it can?
                                                <br><br>"Ah," he says. "Here's where I get to blow your mind. Very
                                                exciting. We are not interested in escaping a dying world. For us this
                                                is not an act of panic or, ah... adrenal survival reflex. The Odyssey,
                                                under the stewardship of Far Zenith, will be a triumph, not a retreat.
                                                This is why we will succeed. Why we already have succeeded, really."
                                                Osvald makes it hard to press for answers. His answers are labyrinthine,
                                                but something in his tone and his body language makes them feel
                                                downright linear. How much of this is a put-on and - [DATA CORRUPTED].

                                                <br><br><b>HIGH ORBIT, April 1, 2065</b> - "We're not blind to the irony
                                                of making this announcement on April First," said Far Zenith spokesman
                                                Osvald Dalgraad in a live holocast this morning. "But I can assure you:
                                                this is not a prank. Construction on the Odyssey is complete. All
                                                systems appear to be entirely operational. In short: we're ready to go.
                                                All that remains is to run comprehensive system tests - especially of
                                                the bleeding-edge anti-matter pulse drives - and resolve various minor
                                                logistical details."
                                                <br><br>The announcement comes a mere four years after Far Zenith's
                                                purchase of the derelict Odyssey, abandoned in orbit in July 2057.
                                                Dalgraad wrapped the announcement by fielding questions from press
                                                log-ons. Of the size of the crew, Dalgraad said, "Adult humans? Very
                                                minimal. Fifty to sixty individuals. But of course the living and
                                                breathing folks aren't the real headcount here - that'd be the 200,000
                                                zygotes in cryo-storage." When asked about the projected launch date,
                                                Dalgraad answered, "We're absolutely going to hit this July date.
                                                Obviously we would have loved another few years to train our crew, but
                                                with the situation on Earth deteriorating as it is, we've decided to
                                                move aggressively."
                                                <br><br>Asked if he has any parting words for humanity, Osvald nods
                                                solemnly. "We share the hope that Zero Dawn will reverse Earth's
                                                terrible crisis. Either way, we at Far Zenith are committed to doing all
                                                we can do to ensure that humanity has a future, if not on its home
                                                planet, then elsewhere."
                                                <br><br>As to the remaining seventy-six members of Far Zenith and their
                                                identities, Dalgraad remained characteristically coy. "They're fine," he
                                                said. "Thanks for asking."

                                                <br><br>The founder ARAMAN, who guided our forefathers from the shadow
                                                of the Savage East, into the fastness of the mesa valley; and who,
                                                reading the signs of Sun and Shadow both, delivered them to the site of
                                                holy Meridian;
                                                <br><br>The bounteous AMAVAD, who oversaw the clearing and sowing of the
                                                Royal Maizelands so that none who walked in the Sun's favor should go
                                                hungry again; who cut back the Jewel to claim the rich estatelands for
                                                the first Houses of the Sun-Court;
                                                <br><br>The far-seeing SADAHIN, who expanded the Sun's dominion to the
                                                north, south and east, setting a gate at Brightmarket harbor; and who
                                                before the Sun at its highest proclaimed these lands would be known as
                                                the Carja Sundom, so by the light it was good;
                                                <br><br>Generous JUWADAN, who stocked the metal markets with the spoils
                                                of his own Trampler hunts; and who allowed trade from north and south,
                                                even permitting outlanders the gift of the counting glyphs so they might
                                                understand more than simple barter;
                                                <br><br>ZAVARAD, the pilgrim Sun-King, whose tower was raised to the top
                                                of the Ridge of Veils and who crossed the great waters of the Daybreak,
                                                so the Sundom might extend ever further; and to honor this passage had
                                                the great Blazon Arch raised on the far shores;
                                                <br><br>Bold IRIV, who saw the Sun's passing into the West as a
                                                challenge, and forged after it with a great army, to be pushed back
                                                three times at the great canyons that would be known as the Daunt; until
                                                on the fourth time his cohort broke through, and were vanished in the
                                                lands beyond;
                                                <br><br>Prudent BASADID, who had the mantle of his fallen brother thrust
                                                upon him suddenly; who ordered the construction of the fortress of
                                                Sunfall and the garrison at Blazon Arch, declaring the land beyond it
                                                the Forbidden West where only the Sun may go;
                                                <br><br>KHUVADIN the returner, who strove to bring civilization to the
                                                Savage East, but returned after many strenuous endeavors, saying it was
                                                no longer fit for the people of the Sun; and called for the building of
                                                great towers and walls so this wild land might be observed safely;
                                                <br><br>RANAN, the Firebird, who saw the Sundom suffer unprovoked attack
                                                by the Tenakth horde, and who against the protests of his advisors
                                                accompanied his army to confront them; under the Sun he claimed victory,
                                                though he was so greatly scarred he wore his blazon helmet from that
                                                day;
                                                <br><br>NAHASIS, who was a hunter as much as a Sun-King, and called for
                                                the proudest men of the noble Houses to prove themselves in competition
                                                beneath the Sun, and that those who felled the greatest machines would
                                                be situated as the first Sunhawk and Hawks of the Hunters Lodge;
                                                <br><br>The illuminated MARZID, who the Sun visited with visions so
                                                vivid and grand, he commissioned many statues and frescoes of his visage
                                                in Meridian; and for his summer palace in Sunfall had the great Citadel
                                                raised, where he remained painting until he took deathly ill from his
                                                own pigments;
                                                <br><br>HIVAS, elder brother of Marzid, who decreed each family with a
                                                suitable male child should submit that child in service of the Sundom's
                                                then-depleted ranks; and had the artisans turn their attention from
                                                works of art to outfitting each soldier of the Sun with the very finest
                                                armor, halberd and bow;
                                                <br><br>JIRAN, who in his early years was a strong Sun-King, defending
                                                the Sundom from the encroachment of other tribes and the Derangement of
                                                the machines; but who became greatly addled, and ordered the spilling of
                                                blood in the Sun's name, threatening to bring a twilight time upon us;
                                                <br><br>AVAD, the Liberator --

                                                by Inquiring Jandiniman, Historian-In-Residence at the Hunters Lodge
                                                <br><br>In time, all creatures fall, all legends fade away. Such it was
                                                with Redmaw, deadliest of Thunderjaws.
                                                <br><br>In the summer of the third year of the reign of the Sun-King
                                                Avad, Sunhawk Ahsis received word of a sighting and set out after the
                                                beast. Talanah, Hawk of the Lodge, went soon after, quickly followed by
                                                her Thrush, Aloy of the Nora.
                                                <br><br>Fearing Talanah might take Redmaw first and thus supplant him as
                                                Sunhawk, Ahsis resorted to treachery, laying a trap for the Hawk. Nine
                                                mercenaries ambushed her, but aided by her Thrush, Talanah defeated them
                                                all (six shot, three blasted).
                                                <br><br>Hawk and Thrush continued after Redmaw, arriving just as the
                                                legendary monster took Sunhawk Ahsis out of the fight (lash of the
                                                tail). Working together, the two women finally defeated Redmaw in a
                                                fight for the ages.
                                                <br><br>Alas, the wounds that Ahsis sustained were mortal (crushed
                                                internal organs, evidence of bowel failure) and he did not live to see
                                                Talanah take his place as Sunhawk.
                                                <br><br>So ends the Record of Redmaw, most murderous of machines.

                                                The History of Sunfall
                                                <br><br>After the vanishing of the Radiant Iriv and his cohort in the
                                                West, the Radiant Basadid ordered a mighty fortress built at the
                                                Sundom's farthest reach. His Luminance chose to build atop ancient
                                                ruins, reasoning the ancients must have seized upon the location for its
                                                strategic value.
                                                <br><br>Of the ancients, their works of too-smooth grey stone and
                                                strangely-carved metal were collapsed or built over, and the catacombs
                                                sealed off. Only the stone ring, perhaps used for some unknowable
                                                ritual, was left in place, to serve the garrison as a training ground.
                                                <br><br>Even though its builders and soldiers lived in fear of the land
                                                where the Sun goes at night, the finished walls of the fortress were
                                                mighty and unshakeable. His Luminance and his High Priest, the
                                                Irrefutable Pashaman, named it Sunfall under the blazing eye of the Sun,
                                                and by the light it was good.
                                                <br><br>None doubted the Radiant Basadid's prudence, nor denied his
                                                lingering hope that his brother might one day be sighted again, but no
                                                great threat would come from the West in his lifetime. Nor did it come
                                                for the next three generations, though records show the men of Sunfall
                                                fought many bandits and scroungers skulking in the Rustwash, and a
                                                dangerous stampede of Behemoths in the Long Burn .
                                                <br><br>In time Sunfall slipped from common memory, until the sixth year
                                                of the eleventh Sun-King's reign, when the Radiant Marzid himself came
                                                to inspect it. In the desert heat, His Luminance received a vision of an
                                                ornate Citadel with a dome of metal so polished it would greet the dawn,
                                                and catch the rays of the Sun's last shining at dusk. At once, he
                                                ordered the dedication of the Sundom's resources to building the
                                                structure.
                                                <br><br>After its construction, His Luminance took the Citadel as his
                                                summer palace, bringing with him many members of the Sun-Court, nobles
                                                and artisans. In time, Sunfall became a city unto itself, and the source
                                                of great works such as <i>Passion of the Tallneck Among the Dunes</i>,
                                                <i>Turning Seasons at Bronzeflash</i>, and <i>Lament For Cinnabar
                                                    Sands</i>. The stone training ring was repurposed for shows of
                                                pageantry, where young blazons or the Hunters Lodge Hawks could display
                                                the Sun's dominance over the machines.
                                                <br><br>Sunfall's prominence in the culture of the Sundom continued for
                                                many years, until the Sun-King Marzid's untimely demise in the Citadel
                                                he so treasured. For his procession back to the Alight, a line of
                                                torches was laid all the way across the Daybrink, so that over the days
                                                and nights of his bearing he might always go in Light. The departed
                                                king's brother, the Radiant Hivas, was occupied wholly with renewing the
                                                soldiery of the Sundom, and with the old Sun-King's passing so too
                                                passed this chapter in Sunfall's history.
                                                <br><br>In the early years of the thirteenth Sun-King Jiran's reign,
                                                before the falling of his shadow, a particularly harsh season came upon
                                                the Sandwhisper Valley. Upon hearing that the storms could strip the
                                                very detailing off armor, he decreed that strongest among his guard
                                                should be trained in the desert here, and named Kestrels. Indeed Helis,
                                                who would become the most infamous of the Kestrels, was one of the first
                                                to survive his reforging by Sun and sand here.
                                                <br><br>In the fifteenth year of Sun-King Jiran's reign, when the
                                                sacrifices in the Sun-Ring were judged insufficient to calm the
                                                Derangement of the machines, he presided over the blooding of the ring
                                                at Sunfall. A trapped Behemoth was driven with spears and spurred over
                                                slaves of the Oseram and Utaru. When the beast turned upon the kestrels,
                                                the Sun-King stood and declared that the Sun, in its great generosity,
                                                would accept the sacrifice of faithless and faithful alike.
                                                <br><br>So began a fearful era for Sunfall, of sacrifices unending in
                                                its Sun-Ring, and the Citadel whispered of as a place where no light
                                                shone. Many upstanding citizens of the Sundom were taken inside its
                                                doors to disappear as surely as if they had journeyed to the forbidden
                                                West. In the last days of Sun-King Jiran's reign, Sunfall was in the
                                                charge of his kestrels and High Priest, no longer answering to the
                                                Sundom as a whole.
                                                <br><br>It was no surprise, then, that following the liberation of
                                                Meridian, Jiran's loyalists sought refuge at Sunfall. As a fortress it
                                                was impregnable, but cut off from the bounteous lands across the
                                                Daybrink, it was a city impoverished. So stood the stalemate, in the
                                                first year of the fourteenth Sun-King, the Radiant Avad, and so stood
                                                Sunfall. Once built to protect the Sundom from the shadow of the West,
                                                it now sheltered a worse shadow: the false Carja who dwelt within.

                                                Bylaws of the Hunters Lodge
                                                <br><br>Section 1: Preamble
                                                <br><br>1.1. The hunt is the noblest pursuit in the Sundom, save those
                                                of the Sun-King and his Sun-Priests. The hunt is strength. The hunt is
                                                honor. The hunt protects. The hunt preserves.<br />
                                                1.2. What is the hunt but competition? What is competition without rank,
                                                honor, and victor?<br />
                                                1.3. The Lodge lends law and lore to the hunt, so all will know who has
                                                prevailed.<br />
                                                1.4. Thus the Lodge is not just its members, and not just its House in
                                                Meridian: it is the spirit of the hunt, a code to be honored, an ideal
                                                to be lived.<br />
                                                1.5. Only those of the noblest blood can embody the noblest ideals. As
                                                such, only Carja males of pure blood may honor the Lodge and tread its
                                                House.<br />
                                                1.6. By order of his radiance Avad, 14th Sun-King of the Carja, bylaw 5
                                                of Section 1 is hereby rescinded.
                                                <br><br>Section 2: Membership
                                                <br><br>2.1. No hunter shall gain admittance to the Lodge without three
                                                Half Suns, won with honor at any Hunting Ground (see Section 5,
                                                below).<br />
                                                2.2. There are two classes of member, Hawk being senior, Thrush being
                                                junior.<br />
                                                2.3. The rank of Thrush can only be gained through the sponsorship of a
                                                Hawk. Each Hawk may sponsor only one Thrush.<br />
                                                2.4. There can be only seven Hawks. A Thrush can only become a Hawk
                                                through the death of his sponsor.<br />
                                                2.5. The Hawk who hunts the greatest prey shall become Sunhawk and lead
                                                the Lodge.<br />
                                                2.6. In the event the quality of prey is in dispute, the Hawk who hunted
                                                first shall remain first, as Sunhawk.<br />
                                                2.7. Only Carja males of pure blood may become Thrush, Hawk, or
                                                Sunhawk.<br />
                                                2.8. By order of his radiance Avad, 14th Sun-King of the Carja, bylaw 7
                                                of Section 2 is hereby rescinded.
                                                <br><br>Section 3: Proof of the Hunt
                                                <br><br>3.1. The greatest hunts often bear no witness; therefore, a
                                                trophy must be kept.<br />
                                                3.2. A trophy may be submitted to the Sunhawk as proof of a victorious
                                                hunt.<br />
                                                3.3. A trophy must be intact, undamaged, and from a recent hunt.<br />
                                                3.4. The Sunhawk shall have final authority in any dispute over a
                                                trophy's worth.<br />
                                                3.5. Only Carja males of pure blood may submit a trophy to the
                                                Sunhawk<br />
                                                3.6. By order of his radiance Avad, 14th Sun-King of the Carja, bylaw 5
                                                of Section 3 is hereby rescinded.
                                                <br><br>Section 4: To Protect and Preserve
                                                <br><br>4.1. A hunt for its own sake is noble: a hunt in the service of
                                                others is blessed by the Sun.<br />
                                                4.2. When called upon, Hawks and Thrushes must undertake any reasonable
                                                hunt asked of them, if it serves to protect the citizens of the
                                                Sundom.<br />
                                                4.3. The Sunhawk has sole authority to negotiate any fees or bounties
                                                associated with any hunt undertaken by members of the Lodge on behalf of
                                                the Sundom.<br />
                                                4.4. Any profit from any hunt undertaken by members of the Lodge on
                                                behalf of the Sundom shall be shared by all seven Hawks, administered by
                                                the Sunhawk.<br />
                                                4.5. Only Carja males of pure blood may undertake a hunt in the name of
                                                the Lodge, be it for the protection of the Sundom or any other
                                                reason.<br />
                                                4.6. By order of his radiance Avad, 14th Sun-King of the Carja, bylaw 5
                                                of Section 4 is hereby rescinded.
                                                <br><br>Section 5: Hunting Grounds
                                                <br><br>5.1. For the purpose of training and recruiting the best and
                                                greatest hunters, the Lodge shall provide and maintain Hunting
                                                Grounds.<br />
                                                5.2. Each Hunting Grounds shall test a different range of skills through
                                                three Trials crafted by its Keeper, in consultation with the
                                                Sunhawk.<br />
                                                5.3. There shall be three rewards for each Trial, in ascending order of
                                                performance: Half Sun, Full Sun, Blazing Sun.<br />
                                                5.4. Hunters who prove themselves by winning the requisite number of
                                                Suns may be entitled to special gear at the Lodge, at the discretion of
                                                the Sunhawk.<br />
                                                5.5. The Lodge shall provide funds for the construction and maintenance
                                                of all Trials and facilities at Hunting Grounds.<br />
                                                5.6. The Lodge shall receive all profits associated with the sale of
                                                parts, ammunition, and equipment from all Hunting Grounds.<br />
                                                5.7. Any profits received from Hunting Grounds shall be shared by all
                                                seven Hawks, administered by the Sunhawk.<br />
                                                5.8. Keepers shall be chosen exclusively by the Sunhawk, and serve for a
                                                term of seven years.<br />
                                                5.9. Only Carja males of pure blood may be appointed Keeper.<br />
                                                5.10. By order of his radiance Avad, 14th Sun-King of the Carja, bylaw 9
                                                of Section 5 is hereby rescinded.

                                                by the Well-Traveled Aram
                                                <br><br>Often, I fling open the windows of my villa not only to partake
                                                of the scents and sights of the city, but to hear the questions on the
                                                streets. Equally often, I hear asked aloud: what to make of these
                                                outsiders, these Oseram, who are suddenly our allies or even neighbors?
                                                Why do they eat as they do, argue as they do? What is the matter of
                                                their heady scent? Why are they always drinking?
                                                <br><br>Like a ray of the Sun amid the darkness, a question is best
                                                followed to its source. So, for the benefit of the inquisitive, I
                                                contrived to join a trading caravan to the Claim, at least as far as the
                                                closest village beyond the Breakwalls.
                                                <br><br>The Claim. It is a muted land, where fire-smoke hangs heavy in
                                                the air among the tall, thin trees. Where the ground has not been dug up
                                                in the Oseram's ceaseless search for metal, it is cased in frost, and
                                                beneath the frost, yet more frost, before stony soil. And worse, soot.
                                                Everywhere, soot, all-pervading. Though I had worn my sturdiest travel
                                                silks, keeping them unsoiled proved impossible. Noticing my discomfort,
                                                some Oseram washer-women offered their services, but seeing the shade of
                                                the water in their tubs I declined.
                                                <br><br>Indeed, regard for cleanliness is not an Oseram virtue. Despite
                                                its protective walls of piled slate and slouched round stone huts, the
                                                village struck me as overly exposed to the elements-- the chief elements
                                                in the Claim being a cold, oily rain, and hoarfrost. Even so, the open
                                                fires hissed and spat and burned on, and the mood was bustling and
                                                lively... much as you might find in an outbuilding for livestock, for
                                                example. (What I will endure to bring the light of knowledge to the folk
                                                of my tribe.)
                                                <br><br>The Oseram have no priests or kings, and spit at the mention of
                                                such titles, but they defer to the counsel of their wise men, the
                                                village 'ealdormen'. It seems each settlement elects such men for the
                                                purpose of unceasing argument. From dawn until long into the night, they
                                                shout over each other on matters of policy and taxation. Come the next
                                                morning, a line of villagers will already have formed for the privilege
                                                of arguing back.
                                                <br><br>I joined such a line for several hours while children squealed,
                                                birds squawked and hammering-- accursed, endless hammering-- echoed over
                                                the trampled straw and rain-filled cart ruts. Finally, I was permitted
                                                to face the three ealdormen and deliver my question. I asked for their
                                                opinion on the peace between our tribes, and Sun-King Avad's offer of
                                                welcome in Meridian itself.
                                                <br><br>Readers, I say asked, but the matter was not so simple, as the
                                                Oseram erupted into insults and arguments even before the words had
                                                finished leaving my lips. I found myself talked over, shouted down,
                                                subjected to seemingly unconnected abuse, and it was only when I raised
                                                my voice in return-- an invigorating experience-- that I was grudgingly
                                                answered.
                                                <br><br>Their opinions are muddled and mixed, to say the least, and I
                                                will not profane this parchment by transcribing the words used to
                                                express them. Suffice it to say that they see the benefit of free trade
                                                between our tribes, and indeed have flourished from it, after long years
                                                of war. However, it seems few Oseram that trade outside the Claim return
                                                their taxes, or even return at all-- the ealdormen believe they are
                                                stolen away by a manner of living that is "downright Carja." A phrase
                                                they punctuate by spitting on the floor.
                                                <br><br>In return, I suggested that their mistrust and fear of a
                                                civilized way of life was positively Oseram (I could not bring myself to
                                                spit indoors.) This caused great commotion, after which I was bodily
                                                carried from the building upon the shoulders of my hosts, and deposited
                                                in the midst of a coming-of-age celebration-- not for a man, but for
                                                some new manner of device.
                                                <br><br>I awoke on a cart arriving at Pitchcliff. My throat was hoarse,
                                                my arms numbed from accepting countless challenges to wrestle, and the
                                                taste of an alcohol much like machine oil was still on my tongue. My
                                                head ached as if split down the center. Truly, I had risked my life in
                                                search of an answer: is there more to the Oseram character than
                                                brawling, drinking, and shouting?
                                                <br><br>Simply put, dear reader, there is not-- but let us hope that the
                                                ealdormen's fears will be proven true, and in time the Sun's light and
                                                Meridian's glory can temper these rough-hewn folk.

                                                The Founding Of Meridian
                                                <br><br>We are Carja. In us is the blood of those led by Araman from
                                                persecution and pursuit, so long ago. Out of the far Savage East we
                                                came, guardians of a treasure greater than land or metal: the Leaves of
                                                the Old Ones.
                                                <br><br>Araman found the Leaves in a ruin, picked out by a beam of
                                                sunlight, and he recognized at once their importance. Within was etched
                                                the first teachings of how to observe the Sun, to recognize its
                                                guidance, and to understand the place of man. From out of the Leaves
                                                came the first glyphs, the first writing, so our knowledge could last
                                                longer than voices.
                                                <br><br>But when our forefathers offered to share this gift, they were
                                                driven out by those they had once called tribesfolk--these ones feared
                                                to have the light of knowledge brought to bear on their ignorance, or
                                                were jealous of its power. And so began the long wandering of our
                                                people, trusting only that the Sun would guide them and deliver them
                                                from the barbarian tribes.
                                                <br><br>The path was hard, and marked by the stones of families who fell
                                                along the wayside--even Araman's own. The persecution was unceasing,
                                                from those without purpose, only the desire to debase and destroy. But
                                                the faith of the Carja was rewarded with a distant vision--a tower like
                                                a solid ray of the Sun, holding on the horizon, flashing!
                                                <br><br>Even as their enemies descended upon them, Araman followed the
                                                flight of the Glinthawks, leading his people through looming canyons and
                                                teeming jungles. Again they saw the tower, so close now it seemed to
                                                reach the very Sun itself, and they saw that the Glinthawks perched upon
                                                it.
                                                <br><br>Beheld in the light of the Sun, the tower--the Spire--cast its
                                                long shadow upon a mesa across the verdant valley. Araman knew he had
                                                found a haven for the tribe, as this was a place shunned by those
                                                without his faith--who cowered from the magnificence of the Spire, or
                                                the shining feathers of the Glinthawks.
                                                <br><br>He named this place MERIDIAN, from a passage in the Leaves, and
                                                the tribe settled in the protection of the great mesa. They found the
                                                site was blessed in every respect, carving their cliff-houses from the
                                                bounteous resources, and in time from the red rock of mesa
                                                itself--crowning it with the first columns of the City of the Sun.
                                                <br><br>Truly the Sun gave much to the descendants of our forefathers,
                                                granting Meridian great harvests and prosperity, and the bounds of the
                                                Sundom for as far as its light touched. In time, seeing Meridian
                                                shielded us from the dark arrows and plots of our foes, other foreigners
                                                brought trade and tribute.
                                                <br><br>Holy Meridian! Without Spire and Sun, there would be no
                                                Meridian, but now and forevermore it stands as monument to both. And the
                                                glory of Araman and the founders is reflected anew in each Sun-King of
                                                the Radiant Line, and the noble Houses of the Sun-Court.

                                                The Liberation of Meridian
                                                <br><br>An official account as scribed by the Reckoners of the
                                                Sun-Priests and marked with the emblems of Truth by Exacting Varan, who
                                                witnessed these events.
                                                <br><br>In the twenty-first year of the thirteenth Sun-King Jiran's
                                                reign, the twilight time of his madness, the Sun-King's own favored heir
                                                was put to death. The Radiant Kadaman's crime was to demand an end to
                                                his father's acts of bloodshed, and his sacrifice set that end in
                                                motion.
                                                <br><br>Jiran's second heir, the radiant Avad, fled Meridian at dusk
                                                with his honor guard, soldiers loyal to him over the Sun-King. All
                                                night, they traveled northwards, knowing that come the dawn they would
                                                be branded as traitors and marked for death. So it was that when Jiran
                                                made that proclamation, they had already traveled far, and in time they
                                                did reach the edge of the Sundom, and crossed into Oseram territory.
                                                <br><br>For Avad was canny, and planned to negotiate terms with the
                                                Oseram. He knew he had an ally among them--Ersa, a fierce Oseram warrior
                                                with whom Avad had a long and unusual history. Two years earlier, Ersa
                                                had been brought to Meridian as a captive, destined for sacrifice. But
                                                she survived the Sun-Ring, killing two Kestrels by her own hand. Thus
                                                did she earn the honor of being made a palace slave, and in this role
                                                came to know Prince Avad. A rare friendship was formed, and Avad
                                                conspired to free his friend, who returned at once to the Oseram
                                                homeland. Now, desperate for allies, Avad sought out the Oseram he had
                                                helped to free.
                                                <br><br>Ersa had ties to the warlords and freebooters who resisted the
                                                Red Raids. With Ersa's might and Avad's keen strategy, they could raise
                                                a warband and move to overthrow Jiran. And as a rightful heir to the
                                                throne of the Sun, Avad hoped to inspire many of his people to rebel, so
                                                sparing Meridian from a drawn-out war.
                                                <br><br>After months of preparation, Avad and his allies crossed the
                                                border and marched on Meridian. As word of their advance spread, many
                                                Carja soldiers fled back to the city, lay down their arms, or even
                                                joined the liberators. Yet wise Avad knew that Jiran's faithful would
                                                defend Meridian to the last man, even sacrificing the lives of its
                                                citizens if it would hold the holy city against siege.
                                                <br><br>He found kestrels and city guard already set in on the walls,
                                                readied to face arrow and shot. But Avad's Oseram allies had brought new
                                                weapons never seen beneath the Sun--thundering cannons, strong as
                                                machines. Avad permitted them to fire their salvos on the outer walls,
                                                bringing many defenders down with great carnage.
                                                <br><br>As the smoke cleared, the liberators attacked in three groups;
                                                one scaled the walls beneath the Temple of the Sun; another took to the
                                                aqueducts of the Palace; while the main force overcame the barricaded
                                                city gates with cannonfire. These were the final blasts fired at the
                                                holy city, as Avad forbade any further destruction.
                                                <br><br>In the streets, too many scenes of brutality and chaos played
                                                out to recount. Among the terrible miasma of blood and smoke, the
                                                Sun-Ring's slave pits were opened and hundreds spilled out, desperate to
                                                escape. Many of Jiran's supporters seized their chance to flee with this
                                                flood of unfortunates. The day had turned, and seeing his forces much
                                                reduced, the Sun-King Jiran ordered his trusted kestrels take Itamen,
                                                his sole remaining heir, from the city.
                                                <br><br>Helis, Terror of the Sun, cleaved a path through Meridian from
                                                east to west, striking down all in his way--ally and foe alike. The
                                                savagery of Helis and his kestrels could not be matched, and so it was
                                                that Itamen, his mother the Dowager Queen Nasadi, and the High
                                                Sun-Priest Bahavas escaped.
                                                <br><br>Avad confronted Jiran in his <span class="new"
                                                    title="Solarium (page does not exist)"
                                                    data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvU29sYXJpdW0/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x">Solarium</span>.
                                                He had hoped his father would answer for his crimes honorably, but
                                                seeing this could not be so, with great anguish he struck him down. As
                                                the murder of a true Sun-King is an unthinkable act, and surely would
                                                plunge the world into Shadow, Jiran's death proved that the Sun had
                                                renounced his legitimacy.
                                                <br><br>Yes. Sun had turned to Shadow on the throne of Meridian, and it
                                                was Avad's light that drove the Shadow out to the west, where it remains
                                                to this day. So was the cycle of things corrected, in this the first
                                                year of the reign of the fourteenth Sun-King, the Radiant Avad.

                                                <br><br>Be warned, reader, that as a true account of the Mad Sun-King
                                                Jiran's acts, these glyphs are blotted in blood. Truly, the savageries
                                                committed can barely be recounted, so pray to the cleansing Sun for
                                                yourself and the teller of these tales!
                                                <br><br>You will learn of the grievous wounds inflicted on foreign lands
                                                in the reaping of sacrifice--the Red Raids! For the Mad Sun-King would
                                                order a whole generation cut from each village, so they might more
                                                willingly supply sacrifices and be harder pressed to field fighting men
                                                on the next raid!
                                                <br><br>The Utaru, who sought to appease with gifts of grain, were
                                                slaughtered in such number that upon the following harvest, the maize
                                                grew black and blue with the blood of the dead!
                                                <br><br>Against the Oseram, the Terror of the Sun piled the corpses of
                                                their fallen up to the walls of their villages so his kestrels might
                                                clamber upon the dead to enter!
                                                <br><br>And in the valley of the barbarian Nora, terrors of the Savage
                                                East, such savagery ensued that the trees were drooped with corpses hung
                                                as grim warnings!
                                                <br><br>Should you wish to read of the Mad King's depredations against
                                                his own people, your curiosity will not go unsated. Within are accounts
                                                of the deaths of those sentenced to the Sun-Ring--listed in such detail,
                                                you might think it reported by their own chattering skulls, once piled
                                                outside the city gates!
                                                <br><br>Nor will you find a more harrowing account of his massacre of
                                                the Hunter's Lodge. Reading these accounts, you might imagine yourself
                                                among its brave Hawks as they fought to the last, bloodying the sand
                                                from dawn 'til dusk! Or perhaps in the crowds as the loosed Behemoths
                                                careened through the stands with the crashing of wood and bone!
                                                <br><br>All this crazed bloodletting did the Mad Sun-King take in with
                                                his pitiless gaze, indeed he would not even look away from the goring of
                                                his own son in that ring of death! Yes, fair-haired Kadaman, Kadaman of
                                                the Dawn's Rising, so degraded and doomed for the crime of standing
                                                against his father!
                                                <br><br>Such a true and complete account of the Mad Sun-King Jiran's
                                                miseries cannot be found in the history annals, or heard from the
                                                reckoners of the Sun-Priests. It is with a heavy heart that I scribe
                                                these events, leaving out no shocking detail, but my debt is to history,
                                                and to you, brave reader...

                                                <br><br>1.<br />
                                                Over all the world rises and sets the great Sun, as is plainly
                                                seen;<br />
                                                To all plants, animals, machines and men it gives life, as is plainly
                                                seen;<br />
                                                Of all the tribes, none have scaled such heights as the Carja, as guided
                                                by the Sun;<br />
                                                Witnessing these things to be true each day, celebrating these things
                                                each day, we believe in the Sun and its Light gladly, and without
                                                question.
                                                <br><br>2.<br />
                                                Only the Sun's rightful heir, born of the Radiant Line that dates back
                                                to Araman the founder, is the Speaker for the Sun;<br />
                                                To him the Sun's desires are revealed, and from his lips its desires are
                                                acted upon by men;<br />
                                                He shall be known as the Sun-King, and his word shall be law.
                                                <br><br>3.<br />
                                                In all things, we accept the Sun's judgment.<br />
                                                We offer our bared skin to it so it might burn our sins away. We partake
                                                of its renewal, we wear its heat for a time;<br />
                                                As our skin bears its flush, its bronzed armor, we are made
                                                strong;<br />
                                                In the cracking and peeling away of our old selves, we are made new.
                                                <br><br>4.<br />
                                                In the Sun's light, we shall speak only in truth, we shall strike only
                                                in righteousness, and we shall act as we believe the Sun so tasks
                                                us;<br />
                                                When the shadow falls across us, we shall always remember our
                                                illumination, we shall not cast blame for ill fortune, we shall
                                                endure;<br />
                                                In the coldness of the Moon, we accept there will be stillness, and
                                                death, and endings, until dawn comes once more;<br />
                                                We do this because there are two halves of nature, Sun and Shadow, and
                                                to deny one is to deny the whole of things.
                                                <br><br>5.<br />
                                                As a twilight time came before us, ending the world of the ancients, so
                                                shall a twilight time come again, for this is the cycle of things;<br />
                                                The Buried Shadow shall rise up to eclipse the Sun's light and usher in
                                                great and terrible change;<br />
                                                Even knowing this, we are steadfast in our belief, and trust that the
                                                Sun will again bring a new dawn, as it did for our founders so long ago.
                                                <br><br>6.<br />
                                                Holy Meridian shall forever be the seat of the Carja, the City of the
                                                Sun, and the Spire venerated as the mark of its founding;<br />
                                                A Sun-King born of the Radiant Line shall always sit upon its throne,
                                                for without a Speaker for the Sun its will is clouded;<br />
                                                For either of these to be denied is to invite a twilight time upon us.
                                                <br><br>7.<br />
                                                Clearly the Carja are the children of the Sun, and pre-eminent in its
                                                gaze, but so too does its light touch upon the barbarian tribes of the
                                                north, east and south;<br />
                                                It is the Speaker for the Sun's duty to interpret if the Sun's gaze is
                                                directed in approval, or reproach;<br />
                                                So determined, it is the duty of the Carja to carry out the Sun's will,
                                                even in places where the light does not reach.

                                                Legendary Hunts of the Lodge
                                                <br><br>In the summer of the fourth year of the reign of the Sun-King
                                                Marzid, did Farukawas, Sunhawk of the Lodge, behold a herd of Grazers so
                                                vast that it filled entire the vale below the Farback. His bow was a
                                                harp that day, strumming the melody of the hunt from noon to twilight;
                                                after, one could not walk a single step across the glen without tripping
                                                on an antler of the fallen. It took all seven Hawks and all seven
                                                Thrushes to gather the trophies, and with the bounty from their barter
                                                the last wing of the Lodge was raised.
                                                <br><br>In the winter of the seventh year of the reign of the Sun-King
                                                Hivas, did Darusiv, Hawk of the Lodge, stalk a herd of Tramplers from
                                                Sandwhisper Valley to the foothills of the Palereach. Bombs from his
                                                sling fell as hailstones, freezing his prey and the waters of the ford.
                                                While the others stood as statues in ice, Hivas set upon the largest,
                                                driving his spear between its plates and taking his trophy before the
                                                rest could even stir.
                                                <br><br>In the spring of the third year of the reign of the Sun-King
                                                Jiran, as the machines of the wilds grew ever more Deranged, did Khuvam,
                                                Hawk of the Lodge, answer the call from the Prefect at Daytower to slay
                                                the mysterious creature who ripped his best cohort limb from limb. Four
                                                days and four nights he tracked his quarry through the Savage East
                                                before the brute was revealed, strong as a Snapjaw, fast as a Strider.
                                                From twilight to midnight the battle raged, but Khuvam prevailed at
                                                great cost, his left arm chewed ragged at the joint. Thus he named the
                                                beast Sawtooth as he took his trophy from its shattered remains.
                                                <br><br>In the autumn of the eighth year of the reign of the Sun-King
                                                Jiran, as the machines of the wilds grew ever more Deranged, did
                                                Ghalidid, Hawk of the Lodge, follow the shimmering death haunting the
                                                southern freeholds into the jungles of the Jewel. Under that tangled
                                                canopy the hunter became the hunted, glimpsing in the shadows more of
                                                the eerie lights, 'til he was surrounded by machines he named Stalkers.
                                                Long was his flight through the undergrowth to the safety of the Alight,
                                                but along the way he turned his bow to the pursuers, and became the
                                                first to snare a trophy from that which walks in glinting shadow.
                                                <br><br>In the summer of the thirteenth year of the reign of the
                                                Sun-King Jiran, as the machines of the wilds grew ever more Deranged,
                                                did Ahsis, Hawk of the Lodge, dare to tread the path of broken trees,
                                                following the wake of the terrible thing that laid waste to the freehold
                                                of Morning Light. And so he was first to face the might of the
                                                Thunderjaw, greatest of machines that walk the Earth. With spear, bomb,
                                                and arrow, brave Ahsis fought to no avail, and only triumphed by turning
                                                the terror's own cannons against it. The carcass of the beast now hangs
                                                in the Lodge for all to see, so enshrined because its fall turned Hawk
                                                to Sunhawk.

                                                by Inquiring Jandiniman, Historian-In-Residence at the Hunters Lodge
                                                <br><br>It is well known that facts recede into fictions as they become
                                                memories, and fresh facts themselves are ephemeral among the rumors and
                                                legends of the south. This is especially true in the case of Redmaw, the
                                                most terrible of Thunderjaws, a machine which is nothing if not
                                                legendary. Few who have laid eyes upon it have survived, and among them
                                                even fewer can be trusted not to embellish their tales. All that said,
                                                here I have endeavored to truthfully chronicle all the calamities
                                                attributed to the beast, and all the expeditions meant to end such
                                                calamities once and for all. None have succeeded. As of this writing,
                                                the terror of the south still roams free, scarred perhaps, but deadly as
                                                the day the sun first shone upon its armored hide.
                                                <br><br>In the early spring of the eighteenth year of the reign of the
                                                Sun-King Jiran, a freehold was destroyed near the Hands of the Flood.
                                                Nine bodies were recovered (eight riddled with cannon rounds, one
                                                flattened completely). No witnesses survived. Though never proven, this
                                                is widely thought to be Redmaw's first attack.
                                                <br><br>In the late spring of the eighteenth year of the reign of the
                                                Sun-King Jiran, an expedition of four hunters set out from Sunstone Rock
                                                to track the machine or machines responsible for the destruction of the
                                                freehold. None returned. Their bodies were subsequently found in the
                                                south (three blasted, one stomped). Never proven, but thought to be
                                                Redmaw's work.
                                                <br><br>In the early summer of the eighteenth year of the reign of the
                                                Sun-King Jiran, an expedition of six mercenaries set out from Meridian
                                                to track the machine or machines responsible for the losses described
                                                above. One returned (ribs crushed, clavicle fractured). He spoke of a
                                                Thunderjaw which split a man in half with a single bite. This is the
                                                first confirmed sighting of the legendary machine, and the one which
                                                gave it a name.
                                                <br><br>In the late summer of the eighteenth year of the reign of the
                                                Sun-King Jiran, an expedition of eight set off from Meridian to track
                                                Redmaw. None returned. Six bodies were found near Blackwing Snag (one
                                                blasted, three stomped, two eviscerated, one swallowed his own tongue,
                                                evidently in a spasm of terror, suffocating).
                                                <br><br>In the autumn of the eighteenth year of his reign, the Sun-King
                                                Jiran commanded the Hunters Lodge to send an expedition south in pursuit
                                                of Redmaw. After numerous logistical delays, three Hawks and their
                                                Thrushes set out in winter. Only one pair returned, reporting the deaths
                                                of the others (two blasted, one stomped, one decapitated). The survivors
                                                were sacrificed for cowardice (one gutted by a Sawtooth, the other
                                                skewered by Kestrels). After this setback, members of the Lodge grew
                                                wary of pursuing the legendary Thunderjaw; only the proudest Hawks even
                                                considered it. Aspirants to the Lodge, however, foolish in their
                                                ambition, eagerly took part in subsequent hunts.
                                                <br><br>In the summer of the nineteenth year of the reign of the
                                                Sun-King Jiran, the destruction of a caravan south of the Spurflints
                                                (three blasted, two stomped, one immolated) reignited interest in
                                                Redmaw. Three expeditions totaling fifteen mercenaries went after the
                                                machine, with only three survivors (nine blasted, three stomped, two
                                                eviscerated, one liquefied).
                                                <br><br>In the early spring of the twentieth year of the reign of the
                                                Sun-King Jiran, a cohort of twelve soldiers headed from the Raingathers
                                                to the Alight were set upon by the beast. Only one survived (one
                                                blasted, one stomped, ten crushed when their fleeing footsteps triggered
                                                an avalanche).
                                                <br><br>In the late spring of the twentieth year of the reign of the
                                                Sun-King Jiran, three cohorts totaling thirty-four men went in search of
                                                Redmaw. Alas, they were ambushed by Stalkers and only four survived
                                                (twenty-four sniped, six exploded). Understandably, this ended pursuit
                                                of Redmaw for some time.
                                                <br><br>In the summer of the first year of the reign of the Sun-King
                                                Avad, a group of six Oseram traders were attacked by the beast (one
                                                blasted, three stomped, one spit into a ravine). The lone survivor
                                                petitioned Captain Ersa to send the Vanguard after the monster, but the
                                                request was denied. However, three additional expeditions, comprised of
                                                mercenaries and hunters aspiring to the Lodge, were subsequently
                                                commissioned:
                                                <br><br>Autumn, seven men (two blasted, three stomped, one tripped on
                                                his own spear). One survivor.
                                                <br><br>Winter, nine men (three blasted, two stomped, two died from
                                                frostbite). Two survivors.
                                                <br><br>Spring, eleven men (five blasted, one stomped, three "retreated"
                                                off a cliff). Two survivors.
                                                <br><br>The last known sighting of Redmaw occurred in the spring of the
                                                third year of the reign of the Sun-King Avad. Tarkas, Hawk of the Lodge,
                                                got word of a sighting near Thunderhead and set off to take the beast on
                                                his own. His Thrush, Talanah, arrived at the scene too late, just as
                                                Tarkas was dying of his wounds (multiple perforations). Talanah
                                                testified that as Redmaw lumbered off through the trees, she could see
                                                the spear of her mentor embedded in its hide.

                                                I am a traitor now and see no way out.
                                                <br><br>If I start at the beginning--how they turned me--perhaps I can
                                                see something I missed?
                                                <br><br>No. There is no escape. What good can writing it do?
                                                <br><br>10TH DAY<br />
                                                You gave me this folio when you taught me to write. All these years
                                                later, it still smells of you--lavender and ash of the forge. All I have
                                                left of you.
                                                <br><br>Write me notes, you said when you gave it. Share your
                                                thoughts--tear the leaves, send the pages. To show I'm thinking of you.
                                                But I never did. Hands too grubby to touch parchment.
                                                <br><br>How I wish I'd done as you said. How I wish I could now.
                                                <br><br>15TH DAY<br />
                                                The same dream. Your hair in the forge-light, our son's weight on my
                                                shoulders. All of us free. You turn to me and whisper--it is a dream. I
                                                answer--Yes, I know.
                                                <br><br>And then wake. Alone.
                                                <br><br>Even awake my life is a dream--a lie. My treachery will not buy
                                                your freedom. It only buys time. But every moment you live, that he
                                                lives... if treachery is the cost, I will pay it.
                                                <br><br>34TH Day<br />
                                                Every week the device calls me in secret to a new dig. We work like men
                                                with whips to our backs--as though it was left to us to upturn the soil
                                                of the entire earth and time has run low. Scrabbling to find the
                                                carcasses of ancient demons. It's the weapons they want, must be. What
                                                misery am I helping birth into this land?
                                                <br><br>38TH Day<br />
                                                I drink with Erend and Ersa, but not even the sweetest brew can wash the
                                                taste of guilt from my mouth. Every day my silence betrays them. The
                                                villains watch though the device. I keep expecting Ersa to stick a blade
                                                through my throat, but fire and spit, she does not suspect me. A better
                                                liar than I thought myself, must be.
                                                <br><br>54TH Day<br />
                                                Fitful sleep the past three nights, thinking on that Nora girl. Why did
                                                it order her killed? The device, must be. Even so, what threat could she
                                                pose?
                                                <br><br>We heard explosions and distant screams from the village. I
                                                thought the savages might blame us, turn on us. I almost wished for it.
                                                But their Matriarchs ordered us gone. We fled to the border with an
                                                escort of braves, crossed at Daytower.
                                                <br><br>Now I am called to a dig in the Rockwreath. They promise another
                                                glimpse of you, of our son. How I hope to see you both.

                                                A Guide to Ban-Ur and the Banuk<br />
                                                by the Well-Traveled Aram
                                                <br><br>Ah, the Sun shines golden on these times, where one can
                                                experience the whole world without leaving the streets of Meridian--for
                                                the gates are thrown open, and the world comes to us! And yet, as I
                                                walked among the markets, I heard a question on the air again. What to
                                                make of the Banuk, these stoic, silent northern hunters? These men and
                                                women of the ice?
                                                <br><br>Unfortunately for my investigations, Banuk outlanders seldom
                                                remain in Meridian long enough for exhaustive study--it is believed
                                                their cold blood does not take well to the heat. If I was to seek this
                                                knowledge, I would have to undergo the ordeal of taking up travel pack
                                                and quill, and journeying to their homeland. And so it came to be that I
                                                spent a miserable time living among the Banuk in frigid Ban-Ur.
                                                <br><br>Though the Banuk speak of their territory in reverent tones, put
                                                plainly it is the most uncomfortable place in the world. There is
                                                beauty--soaring glaciers of jeweled hues, billows of steam that erupt
                                                from the earth, whirling auroras in the skies above--yes, yes, but the
                                                novelty quickly passes and the bone-freezing chill remains. It is a
                                                country of the Moon, for in the day the Sun is reduced to a needle's eye
                                                through the grey, and in the night, the Moon rises four times the width.
                                                <br><br>There is no welcome, not in the land nor from its people. Though
                                                I lived among one of the 'weraks'--something like a group of families,
                                                but without the civility of a noble house--each member must prove that
                                                they possess the will to survive alone. They seek to always be
                                                challenged, whether at the jaws of a machine or simply in their daily
                                                existence. I tried to explain my position: that a Carja faces a
                                                challenge, devises a solution, and then with the challenge overcome can
                                                live in contentment.
                                                <br><br>This concept horrified them. It was made clear that when I
                                                expected to sleep, I must dig out my own hollow in the snow for my tent;
                                                when I expected to eat, I must hunt food myself. I hid my
                                                disappointment--after all, I had participated in a Hunting Trial or two
                                                in my time--and accepted. On the third morning I was able to bring down
                                                a rabbit, much like those seen in the plains, but with a downy
                                                snow-coat.
                                                <br><br>Upon presenting my prize to the werak, I received only blank
                                                stares, until one indicated I must skin and prepare it. Reader, I will
                                                spare you the details. The experience nearly changed me to eat only
                                                maize-bread forever more.
                                                <br><br>I had barely finished my gory portion before the Banuk set off
                                                on a machine hunt with their shaman, a man with machine bindings sown
                                                into his very skin. (Perhaps another challenge, to decency.) He claimed
                                                to sense the machine spirits close by, and sure enough the hunters and I
                                                followed tracks in the snow to a Grazer herd. The Banuk made short work
                                                of them with their spears, and struck with a curious desire to prove
                                                myself, I threw myself into stripping a fallen machine for parts.
                                                <br><br>Instead of praise for my initiative, I was subjected to the
                                                shaman's cursing and wailing, and hauled back to camp by a sullen
                                                hunter. Eventually, she explained that the machine spirits must be
                                                thanked for the gift of a successful hunt before any parts are
                                                harvested. Truly, I was despairing of the shifting wiles of Banuk
                                                culture, and longed for the certainty of the Sun's guidance!
                                                <br><br>That night, mercifully my last, my companions and another werak
                                                gathered under a pitiless clear sky to exchange songs--their way of
                                                recording history. Some understand the glyphs, but choose not to use
                                                them, asking "What is a song without voices?" (By this point I knew
                                                better than to answer.) My deeds warranted a whole verse in the song of
                                                my companions, but from what I could make out, much was lost in the
                                                translation. Still, there was laughter enough, and many promised to
                                                leave me a Banuk farewell mark for our time together.
                                                <br><br>I parted ways with the werak not far from the High Bloom, and
                                                set about climbing back down to Dawn's Sentinel, and with it Sun-blessed
                                                civilization. As for the farewell marks, I saw no such thing when I
                                                packed my wetly frozen belongings. Another Banuk mystery, perhaps, and
                                                my advice to you, dear reader, is to let these people keep their
                                                mysteries to themselves.

                                                by the Well-Traveled Aram
                                                <br><br>Readers, many times I have been asked to describe that most
                                                fearsome of barbarian tribes, the Nora of the Savage East. So ferocious
                                                are the rumors of these people, you might think it was they who raided
                                                us during the dark times of the Mad Sun-King, and not the opposite.
                                                Well, dear readers, though I possess bravery, there is a shadow-length
                                                between bravery and certain death--and it is certain death that awaits
                                                any who trespass on the Sacred Land of the Nora.
                                                <br><br>However, I have traveled beyond Daytower into the snow-dusted
                                                hinterlands of the Savage East, and on to the very edge of Nora
                                                territory, now the site of a hardscrabble trading camp known as Hunter's
                                                Gathering. There, sat around an open fire with outlanders and uncouths,
                                                I was able to gather tales and eye-witness accounts of what might be
                                                seen within the valley of the warrior-women.
                                                <br><br>They told me another day's travel south lies the Mother's Crown,
                                                a name that suggests something grander than the fort of tree-trunks and
                                                log cabins that was described to me. Still, I was assured it squats most
                                                imposingly upon a rocky outcrop, far above rushing rapids and
                                                white-capped falls. From its ramparts a series of watchtowers stretch
                                                back across the mountains, and at any sign of approach, flaming arrows
                                                arc into the air between them. (For a tribe so concerned with their
                                                precious wilds, I expected less careless behavior!)
                                                <br><br>Those interlopers stout, or foolhardy, enough to approach after
                                                this display are turned back with another flight of arrows--this time
                                                aimed just above their heads. The outlanders, chuckling, agreed that if
                                                a Carja showed their colors the arrows would fly lower, and that even
                                                soldiers behind Daytower's walls grumble about being ambushed and
                                                devoured by Nora warriors.
                                                <br><br>I corrected them that it was the Tenakth, not the Nora, who are
                                                known to engage in cannibalism--in fact, the Nora have only been seen to
                                                chew the bark from trees, the tough plants from the ground, and drink
                                                strange herbal brews. I proposed that they may well be forbidden from
                                                eating meat, except at their strange, feminine rites beneath the Moon.
                                                <br><br>Yes, in the benighted land of the Nora, the natural way of
                                                things goes inverted. Women rule men, and all the might of Carja metal
                                                can be deflected by logs, leather and hides. Ruins filled with bounteous
                                                artifacts go untouched, and great stretches of farmable land are left
                                                uncultivated. Only the machines--which the Nora greatly mistrust, after
                                                some ancestral conflict or another--seem untroubled by this rampant
                                                strangeness. Father Sun has no place here, and I would not be surprised
                                                to find the Nora's woman-god to be the Moon itself.
                                                <br><br>Though it is Nora women who so famously feature in tales of
                                                encounters with the tribe, men have also been sighted bearing the
                                                outlandish hair and blue-painted markings of Nora warriors. It is my
                                                understanding, from reading older studies of the tribe, that a ritual
                                                known as 'The Proving' allows men to battle one another to gain favor
                                                from their rulers.
                                                <br><br>My curiosity to witness this and other Nora rituals sadly goes
                                                unsated, but it is my hope that His Luminance will extend an offer of
                                                alliance to these mysterious barbarians. So emboldened by the Sun-King's
                                                generosity--and the knowledge that I would travel with many, many
                                                well-armored blazons--I would gladly gather a first-hand account for the
                                                benefit of my readers. Indeed, I plan to employ a female scribe, who
                                                might allow better parley between the Nora and I on such an occasion. (A
                                                better path for a young Carja woman than working as a seller for the
                                                Oseram metal-merchants in town, no?)
                                                <br><br>Until such a Sun-touched time comes, though, I can only share
                                                with you copies from the extensive collection of sketches I have
                                                gathered over the years--mere glimpses of these bizarre, savage, and yet
                                                still strangely alluring womenfolk.

                                                The Derangement of the Machines
                                                <br><br>Esteemed lords and ladies of the Sun-Court, honored Khanes and
                                                patrons,
                                                <br><br>Your concerns regarding the continuing Derangement of the
                                                machines are noted. Though many seasons have passed since the first
                                                sightings of this frightful change, the Sun-King is well aware that this
                                                is no longer a matter of reports from border patrols and Hunters Lodge
                                                expeditions. One needs only look to the abandoned estatelands--indeed,
                                                the estates you owned--left for the Jewel to reclaim, or to the empty
                                                freeholds of the common Carja folk.
                                                <br><br>Know that the Sun-King has taken every measure to protect holy
                                                Meridian and the Maizelands with renewed patrols. As for entreating the
                                                Sun, we believe the cause of the Derangement cannot be the Sun's
                                                displeasure alone, for the years of sacrifice under Sun-King Jiran
                                                produced no noticeable effect on the machines. His Luminance and the
                                                Sun-Priests are in agreement that, even if this is an ordeal set for us
                                                by the Sun, our suffering will not be reduced with blood.
                                                <br><br>For your edification, I will recount what we have observed of
                                                the Derangement. Of the simpler machines, the herd creatures, the
                                                gallopers, the scuttlers--where once they fled at the sight of men, now
                                                they are more likely to charge. The larger creatures, once only a menace
                                                to the inebriated and foolhardy, can be seen to lunge at the unwary with
                                                murderous intent.
                                                <br><br>This is to say nothing of the coming of the Sawtooth, or its
                                                metal brethren: the Ravager, the Stalker, or that terrible giant the
                                                Thunderjaw. Each one has proved a more capable killer of men than the
                                                last, each wielding a wider array of strange weapons. The wilds are no
                                                longer safe due to the hostility of these new machines, though to date
                                                they not attacked a settlement within the Sundom.
                                                <br><br>Outlanders have brought no shortage of fanciful explanations for
                                                this behavior. Some suggest that the machines have come to resent men
                                                for hunting them. Yet such a thing has never been witnessed among beasts
                                                of flesh and blood, and they are proven to be more capable of thinking
                                                and memory.
                                                <br><br>Carja hunters and Oseram tinkers alike have attempted to
                                                understand the phenomenon by inspecting felled machines. But these
                                                appear no different to those harvested many years before Derangement
                                                began, with the same assortments of wires, braiding, lenses, hearts and
                                                so on. When these parts are subjected to the light of the Sun, or to
                                                Oseram experiments with fire and spark, they react as they always have.
                                                <br><br>The Banuk, however, claim to have recorded a change in the
                                                'machine songs' of the 'machine spirits', suggesting that these have
                                                become increasingly discordant. The Sun-King has sent envoys to Ban-Ur
                                                to learn more, in the hopes that their mysticism might contain a truth
                                                when the rational light of the Sun is brought to bear upon it.
                                                <br><br>Of course the Sun-King graciously welcomes your own
                                                contributions to study of the Derangement, asking only that they are
                                                delivered in written form, and not during royal audience. His Luminance
                                                also hopes to dissuade you from participating in machine hunts during
                                                these uncertain times. The strength of a united Sun-Court is the
                                                strength of all Carja.

                                                Myths of the Old Ones
                                                <br><br>Any Carja devout knows that the truth of the Old Ones is laid
                                                out plainly in the Articles of the Sun Faith. A twilight time came upon
                                                them, as is the cycle of things, followed by a long night, and finally
                                                our ancestors' birth in the new dawn. Since that dawn,
                                                Carja&#160;history has been writ in the path of the Sun, not the faded
                                                glories of those who came so long before us (even the Leaves of the Old
                                                Ones found by Araman&#160;are long since cracked and fallen to dust.)
                                                <br><br>Nevertheless, collected here for study are the colorful beliefs
                                                of the Old Ones held by other tribes, which may offer a small insight
                                                into those&#160;tribes' primitive views of the world.

                                                as a device, one where all things behave according to mechanical
                                                rigidity and not the Sun's divine rhythms. The movement of the tribes,
                                                of the seasons, even the stars at night--all are accounted for by this
                                                interlocking and complicated mechanism. The Old Ones were the caretakers
                                                of this great machine, but they neglected their duty to
                                                maintain&#160;it.
                                                <br><br>The world-machine thus fell into disrepair, and the civilization
                                                of the Old Ones collapsed with it. Now the Oseram&#160;use their myth to
                                                berate the other tribes as negligent, and to hammer upon their own
                                                importance. How convenient that their tinkers and metalworkers alone
                                                might learn this mechanism's secrets, and improve upon it with their
                                                ingenuity!
                                                <br><br>An even more fanciful tale of censure comes from the Nora
                                                barbarians. They believe that the Old Ones turned away from the
                                                teachings of the Nora's female god, the All-Mother, and eloped with the
                                                machines to build their mighty cities. Having failed to tempt the Nora
                                                to join them, the machines rallied under a great 'Metal Devil' and
                                                attacked the All-Mother. In her vengeance, she stripped the machines of
                                                their wisdom, reducing&#160;them to the simple metal beasts we see
                                                today.
                                                <br><br>Without the assistance of the machines, the Old Ones were left
                                                to wander as exiles, never permitted to return to the isolation of the
                                                Nora and their strange feminine rites. From the survivors of this
                                                so-called punishment grew the other tribes, and this is why the Nora
                                                show distrust to all outside their borders: for we are descended from
                                                the 'faithless', and do not shun the trappings of the ancient world.
                                                <br><br>Surprisingly, it is the Banuk whose belief is most similar to
                                                our own, though their mythology is bizarre in many other ways. They
                                                believe the Old Ones grew complacent, thinking there was no challenge
                                                they could not overcome, and in their pride were undone. Hence the
                                                Banuk&#160;give them no more attention than any other tribe defeated by
                                                the harshness of Banuk&#160;land.
                                                <br><br>In fact, many Banuk&#160;hunters point to the absence of ruins
                                                in Ban-Ur as a sign that the Old Ones were never strong enough to endure
                                                its challenges. They claim that only the machines and the
                                                Banuk&#160;have ever roamed there, and so they have nothing to learn
                                                from the ancients.
                                                <br><br>The distant Utaru, however, believe that the Old Ones are still
                                                with them at all times. In Utaru ritual those who die are returned to
                                                the soil--nourishing the land, and living on through new growth. As long
                                                as the dead are remembered, they will contribute to the harvests and
                                                make them bountiful. Utaru see the richness of their territory,
                                                Plainsong, as evidence of this unique and disturbing cycle.
                                                <br><br>Finally, as there are few living scholars of the Tenakth, we are
                                                regrettably denied any insight from that tribe. From what is known,
                                                though, it seems they have little concept of a wider history at all.
                                                But, of course, this is what elevates a scholar of Meridian from a
                                                bloodthirsty raider-- to be aware of all the Sun's light touches,
                                                however strange and unlikely the tales.

                                                <br><br>These tales of adventure await within--
                                                <br><br>The life of Masarad the Sun-Flash! Whose scales of polished
                                                armor dazzled his foes, whose ribbons of firebird-red arced like his
                                                enemies' lifeblood, so drawn to the clamor of battle that he chose an
                                                outlander's life, far beyond the Sundom! In the north, he crushed the
                                                helmets of clashing Oseram warbands with the very scrap they battled
                                                over; in the south, he stood in sunset against the plains raiders,
                                                plucking their arrows from his body and firing them back. It was only
                                                the lure of the greatest battle of all, for holy Meridian, that drew him
                                                back to his homeland-- and in the Liberation he died gloriously, so that
                                                it took many hours to reveal his still-shining armor beneath the heap of
                                                kestrels piled above him.
                                                <br><br>Of Sadeva, the Desert Rain--once a daughter of the Sun-Court,
                                                but who cast aside noble silks and paints to run with the mercenaries of
                                                the Long Burn. She of eyes like smoke and a flashing blade! Her band
                                                only struck with the sudden storms, for the sight of blood never sat
                                                well with her, and the rain washed away its traces as quickly as it
                                                spilled. And so the sighting of rainclouds was feared from Sunfall to
                                                Brightmarket lest she might appear with them for many seasons, until
                                                they were finally betrayed by one of their own to a blazon patrol! For
                                                her noble birth, Sadeva was permitted an honorable death, and buried up
                                                to the neck in the Valley of the Lash to await the Sun's judgment. On
                                                the first day she endured in silence, yet on the second, clouds
                                                gathered, and broke with a great downpour, and in its passing--she was
                                                gone!
                                                <br><br>The metal conquests of Korgund, the Oseram blacksmith who would
                                                hammer gauntlets into shape while wearing them, and bend barrel-iron
                                                around his waist! He was seen to wrestle the cargo from the backs of
                                                Shell-Walkers, claiming the lightning blasts to be "good for the
                                                constitution"; and overcame a Sawtooth by blunting its jaws, and shaking
                                                it so soundly that its core fell loose. He claimed to have gathered a
                                                charging Trampler on his shoulders and slammed it upon the rocks, and
                                                sure enough there were marks left by its furnace blasted lividly across
                                                his well-haired back. As the Derangement worsened, bringing ever more
                                                terrifying machines, so grew Korgund's desire for greater feats of
                                                strength. He was last sighted astride a rampaging Thunderjaw, grasping
                                                its neck tight as a hawk to prey, and some say he remains there still!
                                                <br><br>And continued from previous volumes, the exploits of Okera
                                                One-Eye! By this point in the telling Okera had lost his left hand for
                                                stealing the Songcores of Estuki, and so traveled to the Claim, seeking
                                                an Oseram forge-smith who would affix a Ravager's claws in its place. Of
                                                course, the only man crazed enough to undertake such a melding of metal
                                                and flesh would be the leader of the Three Chains Uprising...

                                                <br><br>Reader, if you would know of the Forbidden West, there are none
                                                more qualified to be your teller than I, the Considerate Udain, healer
                                                of Blazon Arch. Why? For I yet live, unlike the outlanders who gasped or
                                                shrieked the tales that follow. Foolhardy blazons and madcaps all, they
                                                were brought to me near death, poisoned, mortally-wounded, or driven
                                                witless by what they had experienced in the lands beyond the Daunt. With
                                                such wounds, it was all I could do to ease their pain and try to make
                                                notes from their ranting.
                                                <br><br>As the Sun shines upon me, I cannot vouch for the full truth of
                                                these tales. I only hope they will satisfy your curiosity, and turn you
                                                from the path that led these imprudent explorers and daredevil trekkers
                                                to their deaths.
                                                <br><br>Though each account differs, it is certain that the Western
                                                lands are most unlike our own. Some crossed deserts of palest white,
                                                others deserts the color of fire, or even limitless sweeps of blue sand
                                                that seemed to reflect the sky above, broken only by the remains of
                                                ancient machines.
                                                <br><br>Others spoke of vast prairies of tall grass, each blade sharp
                                                enough to draw blood, dotted with shivering black flowers. Or
                                                incalculable plains of dried mud, cracked like a great mosaic.
                                                <br><br>At night, unknown animals watch with glowing eyes, and strange
                                                birds, all the colors of kites and fireworks, chitter and call out in
                                                men's voices!
                                                <br><br>Most extraordinary of all are those reports of a lake one
                                                hundred times the size of the Daybrink-- so wide the far shores cannot
                                                be made out, and so deep that an entire city of the ancients stands
                                                drowned within. The water is sour to the taste, and sickening, and it is
                                                said to rise up and push back against those who attempt to cross.
                                                <br><br>It would seem that dead cities without number have been consumed
                                                by the shifting dunes in the West, their skeletal towers mired in seas
                                                of sand. The wind is heard to sing a low, mournful song through these
                                                ruins, or through the skeletons of vast metal birds now fallen, or over
                                                great metal bowls now filled with depths of black water, where fish dart
                                                like shooting stars. That song of ruin, rising from a hum to a howl,
                                                still haunted these men and women as they thrashed and sweated in
                                                unquiet sleep.
                                                <br><br>But though the Western lands are harsh, and even their beauty
                                                hides dangers, it is not the land alone that swallows up all who venture
                                                within, that inflicts the brands and wounds suffered by those few
                                                fortunate enough to return. Oh yes, all have spoken of new machines in
                                                the West, machines more strange and terrible than any found in the
                                                Sundom. With their fingernails, dying witnesses have scratched out
                                                impossible shapes, or, if they still possessed several limbs and vocal
                                                organs, mimicked jerking movements and imitated awful sounds, all
                                                belonging in the throes of madness.
                                                <br><br>And what manner of men can live where the Sun goes at night?
                                                These tales were the most chilling. One spoke of drinkers of machine
                                                blood, their lips and tongues stained, their teeth replaced with metal.
                                                Another described youths as pale as ash, all wearing the same faces, who
                                                hunt silently and tirelessly in the night. Still another told of a
                                                tribe, seen only from afar, whose folk busied themselves digging deep
                                                pits in the sand only to fill them in again for unknowable reasons,
                                                while another tribe was only glimpsed on the waters of a great lake,
                                                riding their thin dark boats.
                                                <br><br>O Sun, a half of me regrets scribing these stories, for they
                                                inspire questions that can only be answered by yet more doomed
                                                expeditions. And yet, I must tell the tales, for what else remains of
                                                these poor and wretched men and women? If they sought riches, they found
                                                none to bring back--nothing save a handful of black silt, or a
                                                curiously-stamped piece of metal, a chunk of desert glass with shifting
                                                hue, or an odd smooth shell. I have kept all these things, to remind me
                                                of those who went in search of the forbidden, and paid for it dearly.
                                                <br><br>Reader, if you think yourself an adventurer--heed the warning in
